<h1>WILLIAM COBBETT:<br />
<span class="smaller">A BIOGRAPHY.</span></h1>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">“I NEVER SAT MYSELF DOWN ANYWHERE, WITHOUT
MAKING THE FRUITS AND FLOWERS
TO GROW.”</span></h2>

<p>The summer of 1805 finds Mr. Cobbett again at
Botley with his family. A letter to Wright, dated
5th July, says, “I have found here a most delightful
house and a more delightful garden.” Preparations
are being made for a prolonged stay, and for
the occasional entertainment of his correspondent:
“I have given you a deal of trouble, and hope that
you will find hereafter some compensation during
the time you will spend at Botley.” The carpets are
to be taken up (in Duke Street), and all the bedding,
&amp;c., to be “removed upstairs, packed in mats
or something.” On the 28th of July Cobbett writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am glad that you are like to close your labours so
soon, for I really wish very much to see you here, and
so do all the children and their mother, all of whom <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>have
delightful health; and Mrs. Cobbett is more attached
to Botley than I am&mdash;one cause of which is, she has
made her servants humble, and she bakes good bread.
I shall have made it a delightful place before you will
have finished your volume.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

</div>

<p>There is a good deal about Botley and its neighbourhood
to charm the tastes of men like Cobbett.
A fine open country, which was then to a great
extent unenclosed&mdash;it was a genuine agricultural
and sporting district, of which the little town was
the centre. It was quiet enough, not being on the
road to anywhere; and the people were as quiet
as the village.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… Two doctors, one parson. No trade, except
that carried on by two or three persons, who bring coals
from the Southampton water, and who send down timber.
All the rest are farmers, farmers’ men, millers, millers’
men, millwrights, publicans who sell beer to the farmers’
men and the farmers; copse-cutters, tree-strippers, bark-shavers,
farmers’ wheelwrights, farmers’ blacksmiths,
shopkeepers, a schoolmistress; and, in short, nothing
but persons belonging to agriculture, to which, indeed,
the two doctors and the parson belong as much as the
rest.”</p>

</div>

<p>As Cobbett himself described them a few years
later. The creek of the little river Hamble
touches the end of the principal street; and here
was a tiny wharf, and a miller’s house. On <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>the farther
side of the creek stood the “delightful house
and more delightful garden,” which promised such
bliss. Here is one of the first resulting joys:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now, I am going to give you a commission that you
must do us the favour to execute with the least possible
delay. It is to find out where fishing-nets are sold, and
to buy us a net called a Flue or Trammel net. It must
be five feet deep, and fifteen yards long; with plenty
of linnet, and not too coarse. We have a river full of
fish sweeping round the one side of our little lot of land;
but for want of such a net, we catch comparatively but
few. It will not cost above three or four pounds, and
we shall gain that in fish in a month. But the salmon-peel
are now coming up with the spring tides, and we
hope you will be able to send us the net by the Southampton
night coach of Monday, to be left at the coach-office
till called for. If you should miss that coach pray
get it off by the next after; for this is a subject with
regard to which none of us have any patience. The net
is for jack, trout, and salmon-peel, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>“… The net is excellent. Plenty of fish. Nobody
has such an one in this place!”</p>

<p>“… Since last Saturday morning we have caught
nearly as many fish as would sell in London for as much
as the net cost you. We have, indeed, famous sport;
and I wish to know if Mr. Windham be in town, that
I may send him some of this excellent fish. When you
come yourself we will show you what we can do; and
I really hope that you will be able to get here soon.”</p>

</div>

<p>No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>w, quiet Botley began to rub its eyes. Here
was a new neighbour who kept the wheels of life
well greased. Visitors came to and fro; and the
coach, or the waggon, had more parcels to carry.
The precious scribblings from Botley House augmented
the weight of the post-bag.</p>

<p>As autumn drew nigh, the bucolic pulses were
quickened by the rumoured revival of English
rustic sports. So, quiet Botley was awakening into
something like fame.</p>

<p>One of Mr. Windham’s well-known fancies was
the noble art of self-defence. Cobbett was entirely
with him there; and it so happened, about this
time, that a fatal case of pugilism had brought the
matter before the public. Mr. Cobbett defended
Boxing in the <i>Register</i>, and resolved to promote
all kindred manly exercises.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a festive gathering was prepared,
for this very first autumn. Here is a copy of the
handbill:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Single-Stick Playing at Botley, near Southampton.</span></p>

<p>“On Friday, the 11th of October, 1805, being Old
Michaelmas Day, will be played in the village of Botley,
a grand match at single-stick. The prizes will be as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Prizes">
  <tr>
    <td>“1st</td><td>prize,</td><td>Fifteen guineas and a gold-laced hat.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>“2nd</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;“</td><td>Six guineas and a silver-laced hat.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>“3rd</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;“</td><td>Four guineas.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>“4th</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;“</td><td>Two guineas.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>“T<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>he terms, as to playing the ties, &amp;c., will be announced
upon the spot. Those who have played for and lost the
first prize, will be allowed to play for the second; those
who have lost the second will be allowed to play for the
third; and those who have lost the third will be allowed
to play for the fourth. The playing will begin at eleven
o’clock in the morning; and, if possible, all the prizes
are to be played for on the same day. For any further
information that may be required, application may be
made, either in person or by letter, to Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard
Smith</span>, of Botley.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen coming from a distance will find excellent
accommodation of every kind at and in the neighbourhood
of Botley, which is situated at only about five miles
from Southampton, and at less than four miles from
Bishops Waltham. The distance from London, through
Farnham, Alton, and Bishops Waltham, is a short day’s
journey, being barely sixty-eight miles.</p>

<p>“<i>Botley</i>, <i>23rd September, 1805</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>This announcement, scattered over Hampshire
and Wiltshire, brought a good company together,
and was the precursor of future successes of the
same character. As a matter of course, however,
Envy made of it another nail for the coffin of Mr.
Cobbett’s reputation;&mdash;these things were <i>so</i> demoralizing.</p>

<p>The revels being over, preparations for extensive
planting were made, the month of October being
largely taken up with the transfer of apples, pears,
rose-trees, &amp;c., to the newly cleared ground. A
letter of the 4th November says,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have almost got my trees planted, and shall have
done completely in one week from this day. Excuse all
this gardening plague, and look forward to the time
when you are to find a compensation in the fruit.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following, dated Botley, 1st December,
1805, throws much interesting light on then current
prospects:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;On the other side you will find letters
for William and Nancy, which you will be so good as
to cut asunder and give to them respectively.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Cobbett and I have now fixed upon our plan
and scale of living, and we mean to carry it into effect
directly. We intend to live here from the 1st of May
to the Queen’s birthday in every year; to take a lodging
in town for the three winter months; to put three of the
children to school almost immediately; and, of course,
to get rid of the house and furniture in Duke Street, as
soon as I can get to town and put up the curtains, so as
to make the house look neat and handsome. Of this
you are to speak to nobody. I tell it you for your own
information, and that you may be thinking of a place for
a store-house. Suppose a winter lodging for thirteen
weeks to cost us three guineas a week&mdash;that is 40<i>l.</i>
Suppose my coach-hire to cost 20<i>l.</i> a year (ten trips
between London and Alton)&mdash;that makes 60<i>l.</i> Suppose
20<i>l.</i> a year for store-room (it will not be above half that)&mdash;that
makes 80<i>l.</i> a year. Very well: the house-rent,
the taxes, the water-duty, and the interest of money
upon goods and wear and tear of goods in Duke Street
(besides the interest upon what I paid for the lease),
amounts to more than 240<i>l.</i> a year. The garden-stuff
here is worth 25<i>l.</i> a year, exclusive of fruit of all sorts.
The milk will not cost us above a third part of what it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
costs in town; bread is one-ninth cheaper (an immense
sum in the year); the meat about an eighth cheaper.
In short, I am fully convinced that exclusive of the consideration
of health, and taking into the account postage,
&amp;c., &amp;c., attendant upon this distant situation, that the
saving would be at least 300<i>l.</i> a year. Fuel at Botley
is little more than half the price of fuel in London. So
much for that.</p>

<p>“Now, as to the present, my intention is to go to
town as soon as this job shall be safely over. Then to
let the house, and settle all about that matter. In the
meanwhile, pray go on with your preparations. I like
the type very well indeed; and, having now done with
my improvements and planting (which has been most
fortunately finished) I shall set myself about the prospectus,
and shall, in short, make every preparation for
most strenuous exertions. The post of to-day is not yet
come in: it may bring me something. My present
intention is to <i>fill</i> the next sheet with an address to the
people of England, calculated to make a deep and
lasting impression upon them. I shall endeavour to
show them what has been the cause of all their present
dangers; and shall tell them that, in a future sheet, I
will endeavour to convince them that such and such are
the means of salvation. The time is most favourable
for making such an impression; and, please God, I will
not let it slip. The crisis, which I have always foreseen,
is approaching, fast approaching; and it will require all
our vigilance and all our courage to save our country,
and at the same time to maintain the throne of our
beloved and gracious old king.…</p>

<p>“… The post is come. Thank you <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>for your
attention. The Bulletins may be set up for another
number; but I shall, if I live and am well, <i>fill</i> the next
in the manner I tell you. Adieu. Thank you very
kindly for the hare. Watch the papers well. Pray take
care of the children. Thank you for William.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Wm. C.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>The newly projected great work is “The Parliamentary
History,” which is to contain a full report
of all the recorded proceedings, from the earliest
times to 1803, when “The Debates” were commenced.
A prospectus appeared in the ensuing
February. This valuable collection was completed
in sixteen volumes, and has long since been an
indispensable adjunct to a respectable library.
Yet the name of its projector has, unaccountably,
become dissociated from it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is reason to believe that these enterprizes
were entailing pecuniary embarrassment. The increasing
sale of the <i>Register</i> was producing a
splendid income; but so much new printing&mdash;a
greater part of which would require time for it to
fructify&mdash;along with the settlement and extensive
improvements at Botley, could not but exhaust
Cobbett’s resources for the time. In fact a purchase
of premises at Droxford (a few miles from
Botley), about this time, was made with borrowed
money. Another scheme, early in 1805, had been
a downright failure: this was “Cobbett’s Spirit of
the Public Journals for 1804,” being letters, essays,
&amp;c., taken from the English, American, and French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
journals; a work of inestimable value to the
student of history and politics, but unattractive to
the general reader. The following extract from
a letter to Mr. Wright, dated October 16th, 1805,
makes ominous reference to the money question:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… I have this one caution to give you, which
I beg you will observe; and that is, never speak nor
hint, in the presence of Mrs. Cobbett, anything relative
to my pecuniary concerns, or concerns in trade, of any
sort or kind. She has her own ideas about such matters,
which cannot be altered.</p>

<p>“I have never mentioned the Spirit of the Public
Journals to her; and there is no occasion for it. She
knows I have lost so much by printing, &amp;c., that she is
fearful of everything of the kind. I cannot blame her
anxiety; but as I cannot remove it, it is better not to
awaken it. Always reserve these matters for <i>tête-à-tête</i>
opportunities.”</p>

</div>

<p>And, on the 29th December, in a letter to Mr.
Wright, thanking him for his editorial labours, and
expressing pleasure at having been the means of
giving him another lift in the world, there is some
sensitiveness upon money-matters:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My wishes, my wants too, and your own taste, turn
of mind, and talents, have all conspired towards placing
you beyond the reach of anxiety. But you should now
look further. You should economize as much as
possible.… A horse, a cow, a house, is soon gone
in even trifling things, which we give into f<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>rom mere
want of thought, and not from our love of things themselves.”</p>

</div>

<p>A more interesting message occurs a day or two
later:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mind the twelfth-cake. A good large one!”</p>

</div>

<p>The plan proposed, of spending three months of
the year in London lodgings, does not appear to
have been carried out. During the spring of 1806,
Cobbett was living for a short time at Parson’s
Green, Fulham; and in June he returned to Botley,
permanently, only going up to London when occasion
needed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The year 1806 was pregnant with importance
concerning the future of this country. The accession
of “All the Talents” to power, after the
death of Pitt, marked its commencement; and the
nation was alive with hopes. Another abortive
attempt was made to negotiate peace with Napoleon.
The affairs of India, Military Reform, Lord
Melville’s Impeachment, filled the public mind.
But one matter, above all, which now came to the
front: and which, after many years of lagging,
now had a fair start,&mdash;was that of Parliamentary
Reform.</p>

<p>And that which, at length, furnished the motive
power to the wheels of Parliamentary Reform, was
no other than the invincible <i>Weekly Political
Register</i> of Mr. William Cobbett. Fitful had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
hitherto been the progress made. Few persons of
position had been in earnest about it. Very few
had dared to give definiteness to their opinions;
and the number of those who could be called advocates
of Reform, could be counted on the fingers.
The most prominent of these was Major Cartwright.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>So, upon Mr. Cobbett’s wit and energy being devoted
to the discussion of public abuses, and the only
real remedy for them, he found himself surrounded
by a new class of friends. Cartwright, Burdett,
Bosville, and others, no longer singly held their cry,
but rejoiced in their new exponent. Here was a
man who had been learning all his lifetime, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
could manfully confess his political errors, not only
in mere general terms, but to points of detail;&mdash;a
man who had acquired the high privilege of being
maligned, misrepresented, and threatened for the
odious crime of speaking the truth in clear and
unfaltering, although sarcastic, terms:&mdash;one “to
whom the public eye turned for light and information.”
That was the view, at least, taken by many
of the correspondents of the <i>Register</i>. So, if Mr.
Cobbett was heaping up wrath in one quarter, his
name and his talents were being recognized in
another. The people were looking to him,&mdash;not
the “swinish multitude” of Mr. Burke, nor the
“lower orders” of Mr. Wilberforce, but the people
who paid the taxes and wanted to see where the
money went to.</p>

<p>There was a Mr. Robson, M.P. for Honiton, who
particularly “wanted to know,” and insisted on
knowing, the truth about certain abuses in the
Barrack Department. The truth came out, with a
story very much akin to a dead-and-buried affair,
in which a former Serjeant to the 54th regiment
was concerned. Mr. Cobbett took it up, and even
assisted, by interviews with the parties concerned,
in helping to expose the matter. The incident is
chiefly noticeable, in this history, as being the
occasion, alas! of a divergence of sentiment between
himself and Windham; who, as Secretary at
War, had not met Robson’s motions for inquiry in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
a spirit according with the professions of his out-of-office
days. “Surely there is something in the
air of the offices that lowers the minds of men!”
was the exclamation of Cobbett; “it was with
still better reason than I thought, that I recommended
a clean sweeping and a fumigation of the
haunts of the Pitts and the Roses!”</p>

<p>At this juncture, Mr. Cavendish Bradshaw, the
second member for Honiton, accepted an office
which required him to vacate his seat. Upon
seeking re-election he found an unexpected opponent
in the person of Mr. Cobbett, who hastily
issued an address to the electors, offering his
services, in the event of no other public-spirited
man coming forward. At the last moment, Lord
<span class="smcap">Cochrane</span> appeared, having in the meantime read
Cobbett’s letter to the electors; and the latter
withdrew in Lord Cochrane’s favour.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Mr. Cobbett,
however, made a long speech at the hustings, in
temperate but most eloquent terms; ridiculing the
claims of a sinecure-placeman upon the constituency.
Mr. Bradshaw’s remarks were short;
but they included the instructive information that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the last speaker was a “convicted libeller.” Well,
the people of Honiton couldn’t afford to throw
away their two-guineas-a-head; so, Mr. Bradshaw
was re-elected.</p>

<p>A dissolution of parliament was now imminent,
and the new forces promised themselves a glorious
time of it. The following letter, dated Botley, 7th
July, points to the increasing prominence of Mr.
Cobbett’s share in the campaign:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… As to Mr. Robson’s re-election, I verily believe
he would carry it for Westminster; and I would go up
and aid him with all my might if he would stand upon
my principle. He would surely carry it. Let me know
when the dissolution is to take place. Give me, in your
next letter, the very best intelligence you can get upon
the subject, for I must begin without loss of time, to
address the electors all over the kingdom.</p>

<p>“Between you and me, my opinion is, that <i>I should
not come forward now</i>, unless some body of electors were
to call me forward.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Most men like me have been
ruined in reputation by their haste to get forward. If
the great objects which I have at heart could be <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>accomplished
without my being in parliament, I should
greatly prefer it. I should first attend to my own family.
I am perfectly sincere in all my public professions. But I
will flinch from nothing that may tend to effect the great
purpose of saving the country, which is now, every day,
in more and more danger.… I wrote to Mr. Paull
yesterday. I highly approve of his activity and zeal;
but he is, be assured, too fond of the Bond Street set&mdash;has
too great a desire to live amongst <i>the great</i>, to aim at
the only objects that can save the throne and the liberties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of the people.</p>

<p>“P.S.&mdash;We have at last got some rain, which was
wanted to prevent my trees from being totally burnt up.”</p>

</div>

<p>And, on the 17th:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… I hope Mr. Robson will come down here this
summer, and he and I will then settle upon a general
scheme for an examination into the public expenditure.
We will leave no branch untouched. Pray give my best
respects to him, and tell him to take care of his health.
Tell him that if he intends to stand for Honiton, he shall
have my aid in preference to all other men upon earth
and my aid is something, after all. I think him the most
valuable man in parliament, and I hold it my duty to
assist him in all his endeavours.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following extracts from letters of July-October,
will illustrate several incidents and
opinions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… You opened my nephew’s letter, which I have
before told you I have an objection to. This is what
you would not like; and, in short, it is what I must say
that I cannot permit.… You opened a letter from
Mrs. Cobbett’s brother to her; and I did hope that my
remark at the time would save me the pain of making a
direct injunction like this. I am in no anger, and I wish
to have no answer. The thing is now gone from my
mind, and there, I hope, it never will return.”</p>

<p>“… I greatly approve of what you are about to do
with respect to Mr. Finnerty, to whom I beg you to
present my best respects. As to Westminster, I hope
Fox will live long yet; for I am always afraid, th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>at if he
were dead, tyranny, sheer unmixed <i>tyranny</i>, would be let
loose upon the land. I am in no haste to become anything
but what I am; and never will I be anything else
by the usual base means resorted to by candidates. The
time must come, when either such principles as mine will
prevail, or when no principles at all will be of any use.”</p>

<p>“… Last Friday, I caught a very bad cold indeed,
a-fishing, which I have not yet got rid of, though I rode
ten miles this morning.…</p>

<p>“Lauderdale is off, I hear, but I do not believe there
will be any peace. It is not the least consequence, however,
to anybody. Our affairs in this country will march
on steadily towards the great point at which, sooner or
later, they must arrive.</p>

<p>“I want to know, by return of post, whether Mr.
Robson intends to stand for Honiton; for if he does
not, another person has asked me to write thither in <i>his</i>
favour. This is of great importance; for, I have told
the person that I will so write, if Mr. Robson does not
stand; but, if he does, I am decidedly for him in preference
to any other man. Pray get me the necessary
information upon this head.</p>

<p>“Lord and Lady H. Stuart come here to-morrow;
Mr. Paull will come on Friday and stay till Sunday most
likely; and on Sunday comes another person for two
days; so that you had better come on the 12th or 13th
[August] instant; for we shall have no leisure at all if
anybody is here.… Your pain in your side should
be taken care of. I am sure country exercise is the
thing. I speak from experience. A jolting upon the
coach-box is excellent.”</p>

<p>“… I am particularly int<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>erested by what you say
about Mr. Robson’s views with regard to the next
parliament; and I think with you, that for him to be
safely returned is an object of the very first consequence.…
But, proportioned to my anxiety for his election, is
my hope that what I have heard suggested is not true,
viz., that he has an understanding with Bradshaw. That
were disgrace, indeed! Disgraceful in all manner of
ways; for how could he raise his voice against pensions
and sinecures, after having acted in conjunction with a
sinecure-placeman? This would be so shamefully bad,
that I cannot think of it without shuddering. Surely
Lord Cochrane and he could carry it for Honiton:<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> but
then, Mr. Robson must, and without loss of time, make
his declaration both to the borough and to Lord Cochrane,
or else, he may depend that the whole force of the
Cochranes will be brought to bear against him.”</p>

<p>“… I have put off what I intended to write until
to-morrow. To this I have been moved, in part by a
desire to see the <i>Morning Post</i> before I begin; but, in
truth, much more by a desire to go and see a new
pointer of Farmer Hoad’s hunt. This, viewed in the
abstract, is very bad; but, when it is considered that this
exercise gives me health and nerves, and that these
produce <i>Registers</i>, the time is not thrown away.…”</p>

<p>“… The <i>Morning Post</i> man labours hard.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But it
will nought avail him. He must give us a good reason
<i>why</i> the Princess does not publish the report an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>d
evidence, or he had better hold his tongue.</p>

<p>“I had forgotten the <span class="smcap">Hats</span>. Get them from the same
man:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 180px;">
<p class="caption">(gold-laced)</p>
<img src="images/hats.jpg" width="180" height="180" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Single-stick prize, won at Botley, 8th September, 1806.
20 guineas.</p>
</div>

<p>And one silver-laced, the same words, only 10 guineas
in the centre. The city of Salisbury has advertised that
a match will take place there on the 17th instant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
‘similar to that at Botley.’ The hats must be here on
Saturday at farthest. They need not be very good. A
hat at a guinea will do very well; and as to the lace, I
am sure that it need not cost more than about a guinea-and-a-half.
However, do the best you can.</p>

<p>“Lord Cochrane is here, hard at work a-shooting, but
Mr. Johnstone is not yet arrived.”</p>

<p>“We shall be in town to-morrow night, and I wish you
could come to me about 10 o’clock at Col. Johnstone’s
in Harley Street.</p>

<p>“A glorious match have we had! A fine day, and a
company of people not less than six thousand in number.
The whole of the village was full. Stages, in the form of
amphitheatres, were erected against the houses, and,
perhaps, seats let to the amount of thirty or fifty pounds!
Every gentleman round the country was here. The subscription
pays the whole of all the expenses, without
throwing any more than my single guinea and the price
of my dinner upon me. The city of Salisbury will not
equal this, take my word for it. There were twenty-three
players. The first prize went to Somersetshire, and the
second to Wiltshire. But the great contest was between
the former county and Hampshire.”</p>

<p>“… The little mare went off on Friday. Keep her
well, use her regularly and gently, and I hope she will
prove of use. William followed her with his eyes as
long as he could get a glimpse of her; and the poor
dear fellow could not speak a word all the evening after
she went off. He was made somewhat more happy by
my assuring him that she was not sold, and that she
was gone to you. Fit her well with saddle and bridle,
and have a curb, for she is apt to run off, though <i>your
weight</i> will be a tolerably good curb. The main th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>ing is
to see her well fed upon good hay and oats.”</p>

<p>“… The little dogs came very safe; and they are
both (having been new named Tipler and Daisy) at
Steeple Court Farm, there to be reared up to dog-hood.
I was yesterday at Meon Stoke, where we had some very
fine coursing. We found five hares. Two stole off;
three we coursed, and killed two. There was one large
greyhound dog; but my little bitches beat him hollow.
They go like the wind.… Lord Northesk, who lives
at Rose Hill, near Winchester, has been here again to
invite me there a-coursing; and I shall go next Saturday,
if I am alive and well.”</p>

<p>“… As to your coming down, when you do come, I
wish you to stay a week or ten days. You must go with
us a-coursing; and I will take care to have a good
field for sport provided.… If you never saw any
coursing, you have a great pleasure to come; and you
will see William ride his pony and leap over the
ditches.”</p>

</div>

<p>Amongst new acquaintances of this year was no
less a person than Dr. Mitford, probably introduced
to Cobbett by Sir William Elford, who was a
vigorous Windhamite. The Doctor’s passion for
coursing consolidated a friendship which lasted for
several years; and we find Cobbett visiting him in
December, 1806, at Bertram House, near Reading,
from which place several articles in the
<i>Register</i> are dated. Miss Mitford has several
pleasing recollections of Cobbett, for whom she
had considerable esteem.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>But, of all his Hampshire friends, there was none
so staunch as Viscount Folkestone,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> a rising whig
politician of the day; a man who endeavoured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
carry the principles of his pretentious Party into
practice, and honestly believed that Mr. Cobbett
was, with all his untamable vigour, one of the best
exponents of the current political aspirations. Although
the time came when, in 1834, their opinions
diverged on the Poor Law question, their mutual
regard lasted to the very end.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> John Cartwright (1740-1823) was the boldest and the bravest
champion of free speech, for forty years or more, during the reign of
George the Third. Indeed, he was not unjustly styled “the Father
of Reform.” In early life he was in the navy, but left it after a
short period of service, and became an officer in the militia. He
produced a number of pamphlets, advocating all those ideas of
popular rights which have since his time been generally accepted in
England, the first one being in support of American Independence,
published in 1774. But his writings were heavy in style, and could
not live beyond his own times and the occasions which they served.
</p>
<p>
Major Cartwright’s personal character was lofty and amiable, and
Cobbett appears to have regarded him with peculiar affection. On
one occasion of the Westminster Anniversary Dinner, in 1816, an
opportunity occurred, under the following circumstances, of entering
upon a protest, against the Major being overlooked among the new
men who were finding it worth their while to pin their faith to the
cause of Reform:&mdash;After the two members were toasted, as usual,
there appeared the name of Brougham! Mr. Cobbett’s wonder at
this was changed into indignation upon finding Major Cartwright’s
name at the bottom of the list; and he declared he would not sit
any longer at the table unless an alteration was made. So
Brougham’s name was taken out, and the Major’s put in its place.</p>

began by posting up a bill, having at the top of it this passage of
Scripture, ‘Fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.’ After
this I addressed myself to the people of the place, telling them how
wicked and detestable it was to take bribes. Most of the corrupt
villains laughed in my face, but some of the women actually cried
out against me in the streets, as a man that had come to rob them
of their <i>blessing</i>!” (<i>Register</i>, xlviii. 500.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The following advertisement, to the Electors of Westminster,
was addressed to them in September, and appears in the <i>Morning
Post</i> of the 19th:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Gentlemen,&mdash;Having, some time ago, publicly stated that, at
the General Election then looked for, and in the case then supposed,
it appeared to me that I ought to offer myself to you as a candidate;
having now been informed that, in consequence of that statement, a
very general expectation has been entertained that, upon this accidental
occasion, I should so offer myself; and having, by many
individuals of your respectable body, been pressingly urged to fulfil
that expectation; thus situated, I think it my duty, <i>first</i>, explicitly
to declare that, for the present, I relinquish the honour intended
me, and for this sole reason, that at this time I find it would be next
to impossible for me to devote myself wholly and exclusively to the
discharge of the great duties which, by your suffrages, would necessarily
be imposed; and, <i>secondly</i>, to warn you against the calamity,
the shame, the deep disgrace, that await you and your country if,
yielding to the venal solicitations of the stewards and butlers of
noblemen, you condescend to become the menials of menials, the
laquies of laquies,&mdash;and suffer the popular, the industrious, the
enlightened and public-spirited city of Westminster, hitherto considered
as the ever-burning lamp of the liberties of England, to be
handed to-and-fro like a family borough. Confidently trusting that
you will, with indignation, resent any project for thus extinguishing
the fame of your city and degrading the character of her electors;
confidently trusting that, when you consider that it is to you all
other free cities and boroughs look for an example, you will tear in
rags the gaudy livery now tendered for your backs; confidently
trusting that, when the question is <i>freedom</i> or <i>bondage</i>, you will suspend
all animosities and differences, and act with a degree of energy
and unanimity that shall at once and for ever blast the hopes of all
those who would make you the instruments of your country’s ruin;
thus trusting, and with a mind full of gratitude for the goodwill
which many of you have taken occasion to express towards myself,&mdash;I
remain, &amp;c., <span class="smcap">William Cobbett</span>.”
</p>
<p>
Oddly enough, this advertisement precedes a highly abusive paragraph
on “this low-bred man.” The <i>Post</i> was a good hater of the
lower orders.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In the end, Bradshaw and Cochrane were elected, and Mr.
Robson found a seat as representative for Oakhampton.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This is with reference to a glorious newspaper squabble,
especially entertaining on account alike of the circumstances which
aroused it and of the combatants engaged. The first attempt to
defame the Princess of Wales had just been made, and the <i>Morning
Post</i> took up the illustrious lady and the “infamous calumny” into
its protecting breast. The fulsome style, and the dark insinuations
conveyed, aroused Mr. Cobbett, and he, while asserting his indifference
to the question until there was really some charge, on one
side or the other, upon which to comment, wanted to know what
the <i>Post</i> meant by stating that the Princess had been guilty of <i>no
levities, but such as no woman in the land was free from</i>. Ever the
champion of the sex, he begged for an explanation. Week after
week the question was put, and reiterated with new zest. There
was no answer; but only column after column of abuse upon the
head of the “gross and abominable writer,” “this low-bred man,”
this “modern Jack Cade,” &amp;c. “This gross and abominable
writer is exposed to the merited detestation of all classes, especially
the more elevated, whom this writer has, in his revolutionary cant,
described as the well-dressed rabble of the readers of the <i>Morning
Post</i>. <i>We hope the Attorney-General will look to this.</i>” A very silly
and abusive pamphlet followed, under the wing of the <i>Post</i>:
“Strictures on Cobbett’s Unmanly Observations relative to the
Delicate Investigation; and a Reply to the Answer to an Admonitory
Letter to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, containing an Account
of the True Cause why the Commissioners’ Report has not yet been
Published, and many other Additional Facts, &amp;c.” (London,
1806). Here is one of the additional facts:&mdash;“Vain, contemptible
slanderer! where in all thy calumnious pages is one unanswerable
argument.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Among other references to Cobbett, Miss Mitford records a visit
to Botley (“Recollections of a Literary Life,” chap. xvii.):&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Sporting, not politics, had brought about our present visit and
subsequent intimacy.… He had at that time a large house at
Botley, with a lawn and gardens sweeping down to the Bursledon
river.… His house, large, high, massive, red, and square, and
perched on a considerable eminence, always struck me as being not
unlike its proprietor. It was filled at that time almost to overflowing.
Lord Cochrane was there, then in the very height of his warlike
fame, and as unlike the common notion of a warrior as could
be&mdash;a gentle, quiet, mild young man.…
</p>
<p>
“There was a large fluctuating series of guests for the hour or
guests for the day, of almost all ranks and descriptions, from the
earl and his countess to the farmer and his dame. The house had
room for all, and the hearts of the owners would have had room for
three times the number. I never saw hospitality more genuine,
more simple, or more thoroughly successful in the great end of
hospitality&mdash;the putting everybody completely at ease. There was
not the slightest attempt at finery, or display, or gentility. They
called it a farmhouse, and everything was in accordance with the
largest idea of a great English yeoman of the old time. Everything
was excellent, everything abundant, all served with the greatest
nicety by trim waiting-damsels; and everything went on with such
quiet regularity that of the large circle of guests not one could find
himself in the way. I need not say a word more in praise of the
good wife, … to whom this admirable order was mainly due.
She was a sweet motherly woman.…
</p>
<p>
“At this time William Cobbett was at the height of his political
reputation; but of politics we heard little, and should, I think, have
heard nothing, but for an occasional red-hot patriot, who would
introduce the subject, which our host would fain put aside, and got
rid of as speedily as possible. There was something of <i>Dandie
Dinmont</i> about him, with his unfailing good-humour and good
spirits, his heartiness, his love of field sports, and his liking for a
foray. He was a tall, stout man, fair and sunburnt, with a bright
smile, and an air compounded of the soldier and the farmer, to
which his habit of wearing an eternal red waistcoat contributed not
a little.…
</p>
<p>
“Few persons excelled him in the management of vegetables,
fruit, and flowers. His green Indian corn, his Carolina beans, his
water-melons, could hardly have been exceeded at New York. His
wall-fruit was equally splendid; and, much as flowers have been
studied since that day, I never saw a more glowing or a more
fragrant autumn garden than that at Botley, with its pyramids of
hollyhocks, and its masses of china-asters, of cloves, of mignonette,
and of variegated geranium. The chances of life soon parted us, as,
without grave faults on either side, people do lose sight of one
another; but I shall always look back with pleasure and regret to
that visit.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">“I DID DESTROY THEIR POWER TO ROB US, ANY
LONGER, WITHOUT THE ROBBERY BEING
PERCEIVED.”</span></h2>

<p>In September, 1806, Mr. Charles James Fox died,
and left one of the seats for Westminster at the disposal
of the Whigs. For several years there had
been a truce between the Whigs and the Tories,
over this celebrated constituency, and each party
was represented there. Accordingly, Earl Percy
was quietly suffered to succeed to Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>The Whig nominee was no sooner elected, however,
than a dissolution, which had been for some
time imminent, took place, and the two factions, in
their mutual consent, put up Mr. Sheridan and
Admiral Hood, Lord Percy having declined to
come forward again. Sheridan was a man who was
for the winning side, whichever it might be, and he
now laid claim to the mantle of Mr. Fox, whose
name and whose party had been steadily growing
into favour.</p>

<p>During the s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>ummer and autumn, Mr. Cobbett
had been lecturing the electors of Westminster
upon their duties. He pointed out that, with such
traditions as theirs, there was less excuse for “base
conduct” than in any other body of electors; yet,
that the constituency was sinking to the level of a
nomination-borough. <i>Base conduct</i> meant: clamouring
against “peculators and depredators,” and then
being led by the nose by men who not only
“clamoured,” but pledged their word to reform, and
to inquire into abuses; and who, immediately they
got a snug office, found ready excuses for the non-fulfilment
of their promises. The case in point was
that of Mr. Sheridan, who, now that he was treasurer
to the navy, declined to bring forward charges which
he had threatened, “lest he should thereby create
divisions in the ministry, that is to say, lest he
should lose his place.” Mr. Cobbett was requested
by a small section to come forward himself; but he
refused. The advertisement in the <i>Morning Post</i>
of 19th September, announces his determination
(vide note, p. 14). But he was actually proposed,
on the hustings, by a Mr. Hewlings.</p>

<p>Mr. Cobbett’s candidate was James Paull:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A Scotchman who had been in India, who had been
in Parliament during two sessions, who had brought
articles of charge against the elder Wellesley for his
conduct while Governor-General of India, who was a
little man in point of size, who talked pretty well, who
wrote better than half of the 658, who was perfectly
honest and disinterested, and who was brave to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
backbone, and persevering beyond any man. The
Whigs had all along been deceiving this Mr. Paull, as
they always have done every one else who has trusted in
them. They, by leading him to believe that they would
support his charge against old Wellesley, induced him to
go on with the charges until they themselves got into
power, and <i>then they turned against him</i>, and set all their
whispering myrmidons to work to spread about that he
had been a tailor, and that he was only accusing Lord
Wellesley in order to get some money from him. I
became acquainted with Mr. Paull, from his having been
introduced to me by Mr. Windham, who strongly urged
me to render him any assistance in my power in his
undertaking against Wellesley; and I can truly say, that
a more disinterested and honourable man I never knew
in my life.</p>

<p>“At this election, therefore, Mr. Paull was fixed upon
for us to put forward, in order to break up the infamous
combination of these two factions, and to rescue Westminster
from the disgrace of submitting to them any
longer. This was <i>my work</i>:<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> it was my own project: I
paved the way to it by my addresses to the people of
Westminster.… Hood was the Tory candidate;
Sheridan the Whig candidate, having Whitbread and
Peter Moore for his bottle-holders. They beat the
people, but it was such a beat as pronounced their doom
for the future, as far as Westminster was concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>ed. At
the close of the election, Hood and the base Sheridan
slipped away from the hustings into the Church of St.
Paul, Covent Garden, just opposite the porch of which
the hustings stood, and there they were locked up nearly
all the night, with constables and policeman to guard the
church.… Being in November, there was a plentiful
supply of mud, with which the honourable representatives
were covered all over from the forehead down to
their shoes. I never shall forget them. They looked
just like a couple of rats, raked up from the bottom of a
sewer; and the High Bailiff, and his books, and his
clerks, and his beadles, were all covered over in the
same manner.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Paull had started at the top of the poll.
But as the days wore on, the others gained slowly
upon him, until, at the close, he was left in a small
minority. It was found, however, upon an analysis
of the voting, that Paull had polled 3077 plumpers,
against Sheridan’s 955, and Sir Samuel Hood’s
1033, whilst the coalition of the two latter had given
them each 3240 split votes. Paull’s total was 4481.
These figures were solemnly put upon record by the
friends of reform (as they now called themselves), in
order to show “the manner in which Mr. Paull had
been defeated.”</p>

<p>An interesting conflict ensued, between Cobbett
and Sheridan, which must not go unnoticed. When
the former was attacked by Sheridan in parliament,
in August, 1803 (as before related), it was a wilful
and unnecessary throwing down of the gauntlet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Mr. Sheridan was not the man who should find fault
with another’s popularity-hunting, much less another’s
inconsistency; and Mr. Cobbett proceeded
to give him the inevitable “Series of Letters,”<a name="FNanchor_2_10" id="FNanchor_2_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_10" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with
which he usually favoured the objects of his animadversion.
Mr. Sheridan, now crowing on the Westminster
hustings, imputes <i>low birth</i> to his opponents;
Mr. Paull’s father was only a tailor, and, as
for his bottle-holder, why all the world knows his
story. And all the world (except Mr. Sheridan)
might have guessed what would have come of that.
“Whence came the Sheridans? From a play-actor!
from a member of that profession, the followers of
which are, in our wise laws, considered and denominated
<i>vagabonds</i>.” And Mr. Cobbett proceeds
further, and wants to know what are the public
services of these persons, Sheridan and his son
Thomas, that they should be receiving between
seven and eight thousand pounds of the public
money? So Tom Sheridan offers to fight, according
to a speech of his own at a Sheridan dinner:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This man, for his roughness and vulgarity towards
my father (whom I think I may fairly describe as the
person in whom eloquence may be said to preside), I had
intended to thrash, and for that purpose I went down to
his house with a cane, but he was not at home. I afterwards
thought it best to offer him a pistol, and wrote to
him for the purpose, but this valiant Mr. Cobbett answered
me by saying that he never fought duels.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of course, the only utility of this sort of thing,
was to provide material for satire; and Cobbett, on
his part, never failed to remind Sheridan of his
foibles, nor ceased to look upon his “statesmanship”
with the contempt it deserved.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The result of this general election was promising
enough, to the increasing band of reformers. But,
another dissolution, in the following spring, gave a
still greater impulse to the popular feeling. Sir
Francis Burdett and Lord Cochrane headed the
poll at Westminster, leaving Elliott (a Windhamite),
Sheridan, and Paull out in the cold. It was as
early as this that Mr. Cobbett began to suspect
Burdett’s sincerity concerning Reform; and he
refused, on account of Sir Francis declining to act
with Paull,<a name="FNanchor_3_11" id="FNanchor_3_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_11" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to interfere in this election, although
Lord Cochrane begged him to do so. But the
powerful <i>Register</i> was as active as ever in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
contest of principles which was being waged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We may now glance at some of the correspondence
of this winter, 1806-7.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… This last expression puts me in mind of what
I thought to mention to you in my last; and that is, my
intention to <i>insure my life</i>. A small sum annually will
be well laid out this way; and I feel that I ought to
do it. My family is now large, and it is my bounden
duty to do all I am able to provide for them in the
manner that least exposes them to chance. Pray inquire
about this, and let me know the result of your inquiries
in a few days.</p>

<p>“We send you by the waggon of to-night a fine
hamper of garden things, two fowls, and a chine included,
which we think will be acceptable. Pray send us back
the hamper by the waggon, and also a hamper from Mr.
Paull’s. There is a box at Mr. Paull’s with flower-roots
in it. You may as well send it too.</p>

<p>“Ellen is to be christened on Thursday. Mrs. Cobbett
begs you will send off by to-morrow night’s mail-coach
a good lusty twelfth-cake for the christening.…
Your letters are very cheerful, and, I can assure you, they
come to a very healthy and happy house.</p>

<p>“I propose, in future, to write to you only upon Fridays,
and that you shall write to me only upon Tuesdays,
except upon particular occasions.… In order that I
may profit as much as possible from your correspondence
you should begin a sheet and fill it up as thoughts or
facts occur.”</p>

</div>

<p>A <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>chronic complaint of Cobbett’s, throughout
his life, was being exposed to the payment of
unfranked letters. A renewed notice to friends
and correspondents appears in January, 1807, informing
them that he will not take in such letters.
A message to Mr. Wright, about this time, gives
him directions on the subject, and mentions that
12<i>s.</i> a week would not pay the postage of letters,
of no use at all, and many of them sent merely for
persecution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… The whole world united would not shake my
resolution to <i>reside in the country</i>. The opinions of
‘friends,’ experience has taught me not to prefer, upon
all occasions, to my own; and you know as well as I do,
that those ‘friends’ generally speak as convenience or
interest dictate. As I know you are perfectly sincere in
the regret that you express at not having an opportunity
of seeing me and mine oftener, so you may be assured
that the loss of the pleasure of frequently seeing you,
my Lord Folkestone, Sir Francis Burdett, and one or
two more, is the greatest, and indeed the only, drawback
from the stock of comfort and of pleasure which this
domestic and rural life affords me. It will be very convenient
to us for you and Mr. Murphy to come at any
time. We have had no company since my return from
town, and we expect none; but I am sure that none that
could come would render your and Mr. Murphy’s company
at all inconvenient. The time you mention will be
as good as any. The sooner the better; but you must
stay a whole week. And bring good boots with you, for
we shall make you ride a-coursing. The children talk of
you every day of their lives. William has been out with
us this morning, and we have had a course worth all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
balls and routs and operas that the whole town ever saw.
Hares are hard to find. We sometimes go out without
seeing one; but, when we do find, upon these lofty hills
and open commons, you can have no idea of the beauty
of the course. It lasts but a minute or two or three;
but in one minute these beautiful animals go more than
a mile.</p>

<p>“… We intend putting William to a school at
Salisbury; but I am resolved he shall waste none of his
precious time upon the ‘learned languages.’<a name="FNanchor_4_12" id="FNanchor_4_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_12" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He reads
and writes very tolerably well now; and, if I live so long,
I hope to see him able to do something in the way of
usefulness, in the space of five years from this. He has
learnt to course already. To-day again (for we catch
every fine open day) we had a course surpassing anything
I ever saw in all my life. We were hardly upon the
common when we found a hare <i>sitting</i> (a very rare thing
upon heath). All the rest, namely William, Frederick,
and my man, took their stations in such places as enabled
them to follow the dogs, and to see the course, whichever
way she might take. I then went and started her. We
had a course of thirty turns at least, and, after a very
long and most beautiful course, we had the pleasure to
see her save her life by darting to the copse with Princess
not twelve feet behind her. The dogs were terribly cut
and strained, but they will be well again before you and
Mr. Murphy come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>There is a great importation of American trees
early this year, which gives Mr. Wright some
trouble to attend to, out of his ordinary line; in
return for which he is to have a farm some day,
and American trees to beautify it with. He is
expected at Botley again in March, and is to bring,
amongst other matters, “two quarto blank books,
with a good stiff cover, for Nancy to copy her
grammar lessons in. I am teaching her; she
learns very fast,” &amp;c. And, they “all go to church
of a Sunday.”</p>

<p>An impending duel between Mr. Elliott and Mr.
Paull is alluded to in the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… The third is an article about Paull and Elliott.
Leave out the words <i>manly</i> and <i>excellent</i> as applied to
Paull’s letter; and, observe, soften every phrase that I
have used in commendation of him or his conduct, if
any such you find; for I now see that he has been challenging;
and I will have nothing more to do with him,
until I see a total change of conduct in this respect.”</p>

<p>“… I am glad Mr. Paull is exposed to no prosecution.
I trust he will take great care. I have a hundred
times warned him of his danger. They would
imprison him as sure as he is alive.… I shall
always defend Mr. Paull and his cause; but you know
how I abhor anything covert; and, upon my word, I
cannot say that a man who would consent to be sent to a
hiding-place, ought to be believed upon his oath. Those
that are used to such devices may look upon them calmly;
but this is not, and I hope in God it never will be, th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>e
case with, yours, &amp;c.”</p>

</div>

<p>A petition against Sheridan’s return for Westminster,
on the part of Paull, now provided matter
for discussion; and this, along with the unceasing
campaign against sinecures, and the sudden dispersion
of the <i>lost sheep</i> (as “All the Talents” were now
called), kept the ready writer going merrily. Too
merrily, indeed; a little cloud was gathering. Lord
Grenville confided to somebody, that Cobbett was
destroying the characters of all public men. Lord
Howick<a name="FNanchor_5_13" id="FNanchor_5_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_13" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> became unfavourably impressed with his
vehemence, and threatened prosecution. Above
all, the anonymous press had no mercy upon him,
although it prudently avoided fair discussion. In
March, Wright is asked for his opinion as to men’s
feelings, in town.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As to the result, I fear nothing. And the way to
fear nothing, is to act always fairly and honestly.”</p>

</div>

<p>Only let him have open ground to go upon, and
a good sight at the enemy.</p>

<p>Early in April, Mr. Cobbett writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What you told me about Mitford’s report has given
me some uneasiness, on account of the trouble that prosecutions
would give me; but as to the House, the d&mdash;&mdash;
House, I set it at defiance, if it will only confine its
vengeance to its own villainous powers. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> not, however,
worth while to make any inquiries. It would be a
good jest for the Whigs to begin to prosecute now. I’ll
assure you, I was most cursedly afraid of them before.
Howick is a perfect Bashaw; and apostates are proverbially
persecutors. God knows I need say no harm of
either party. They furnish me with ample quantities of
good and true censure of one another. I am deeply
impressed with the necessity of caution; but if they are
resolved to plague, plague they may. Should anything
of this sort happen, I am determined to plead my own
cause, be the consequence what it may.… This talk
of prosecution has exasperated me against them beyond
measure; and my own safety shall be the only standard
of my vengeance. Villains! They profess liberty; they
set their hired scoundrels to write me and truth out of
countenance; and the moment they feel the weight of
my lash, they talk of the law, that law against which
they have so much enveighed, which they know to be so
unjust, and the administration of which they know to be
so basely partial.</p>

<p>“Cultivate Lord C[ochrane] and Colonel J[ohnstone].
They are good and true friends to us, and, what is more,
to their country.</p>

<p>“Pray send the <i>Chronicle</i>, when there is any violent or
severe attack upon ministers or Parliament. Green<a name="FNanchor_6_14" id="FNanchor_6_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_14" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> has
been complaining to Reeves. The mean dog! Reeves
begs me to spare him. I shall tell Reeves the provocation.
If the rascal thus smarts at a parenthesis, what
would he do at a sentence such as I could treat him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
with? As to the line of politics, <i>safe</i> is the word.…
I hear that my friend Finnerty’s 100<i>l.</i> is coming out.
Oh what a d&mdash;&mdash; thing this writing for hire is! The
motion<a name="FNanchor_7_15" id="FNanchor_7_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_15" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> has cost me more labour than I thought for,
wishing to work in many interesting facts.…”</p>

</div>

<p>The new elections are coming on in April, and
Mr. Cobbett is determined not to interfere, unless
positively compelled. As soon as the election is
over, he will “set about writing sober essays of
<i>exposure</i>: quote from official documents, state the
bare facts, and lament, as I most sincerely do, the
inevitable consequences.” He foresees the inutility
of Mr. Paull contesting Westminster again, and the
event proves that he is right. But he continues his
unasked-for advice to the electors. And he does
keep to facts, facts which all who have eyes may see.
Seats in Parliament are being openly advertised
for sale in the daily papers,<a name="FNanchor_8_16" id="FNanchor_8_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_16" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;in <i>Whig</i> papers;
and this villainous scribbler presses for an explanation,
particularly from that party which is always
flaunting the flag of 1688, and which yet rails at
him, and abuses him, and calls him nicknames, for
trying to hold them to their principles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>As for his own writings, conscious though he be
of their power and clearness, and of the admiration
excited by them in the minds of all who are not
the recipients of his lashing, he will be more than
ever guarded in expression:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… I see the fangs of the law open to grasp me,
and I feel the necessity of leaving no hold for them, and
even no ground for silly cavillers, upon the score of
coarseness or violence. I am armed with undeniable
facts, and my reasoning (at least in my own opinion of it)
shall be as undeniably conclusive. The times are
auspicious to us, and we have nothing to fear but the
effects of ungovernable indignation.”</p>

<p>“… As to the ‘large pamphlet that is coming out
against us all,’ the larger it is, the better it will be for the
author; for the fewer people will read it, and the fewer
the readers, the fewer those who will despise him. That
any creature upon two legs should be so foolish!”</p>

</div>

<p>In the early part of this history, allusion was
made to the growing impoverishment of the
labouring classes. A quarter of a century was
now elapsed, since the Hereditary Pauper started
into being; and his race was now numbered by the
million. The parishes were raising six millions sterling,
for purposes of relief; and the recipients were
going steadily down, down, down. They were becoming
practically enslaved. The average rural
labourer was now feeding upon bread, vegetables,
and water. His children were uneducated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>; his wife
was in rags; his dwelling was either a ruin or a hovel.</p>

<p>And, it is very curious matter for reflection, to
note how ready the comfortable classes were
to acquiesce in tolerating this state of things.
Schemes of amelioration were broached by a few,
but they were generally based upon a total ignorance
of first-cause. Your social tinker,&mdash;amiable,
bland, and very serious,&mdash;caught a glimpse of the
poor wretches so far beneath him; and, straightway
recollecting the words of Scripture, that the
poor should “never cease out of the land,” opened
his purse-strings, exhorted his friends to do the
like,&mdash;and left matters worse than before.<a name="FNanchor_9_17" id="FNanchor_9_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_17" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Your
local authority, and your parson-pluralist, deeply
impressed with the need of preserving the “indispensable
gradations of society,” in their full integrity,
refused a cow to the cottager, lest he
should be thereby rendered too independent!
absolutely ignorant of the fact, that forty or fifty
years previously, the rural labourer not only had
his cow,&mdash;but his pigs, his geese, his beer, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
bacon, and a tolerable share of the comforts of life:
his outward condition, in point of fact, being
scarcely inferior to that of the farmers, and even
the clergy, around him.</p>

<p>Now, in this year of grace 1807, there was no man
living who was a better authority on this topic, than
the hero of these pages. And, what is more, there
was no living being, who had a tenderer sympathy
with the wants and the wailings of the meanest
fellow-creature; be it a skylark, or be it a ploughboy.</p>

<p>And the tinkers, and the tailors, solemnly going
to work with new patches, the only end of which
must be the further enslavement and degradation
of the poor; and the end of which could not possibly
be the healing of their stomachs, or the mending of
their breeches and their gowns; he now bursts out,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I, for my part, should not be at all surprised, if some
one were to propose the selling of the poor, or the
mortgaging of them to the fund-holders. Ay! you may
wince; you may cry Jacobin and Leveller as long as you
please. <span class="smcap">I wish to see the poor men of England
what the poor men of England were when I was
born; and from endeavouring to accomplish this
wish nothing but the want of means shall make me
desist.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Whitbread’s Poor Law Bills<a name="FNanchor_10_18" id="FNanchor_10_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_18" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> of 1807 were
the present occasion of the subject being before
the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The income-tax was ten per cent., and the
quartern loaf averaged eleven-pence, at this period;
whilst the wages of the rural labourer were so low,
that the parish universally supplemented them in
the form of relief. This practice, indeed, had
become such an abuse, that the farmer would
refuse to employ men at fair wages&mdash;throw them
upon the workhouse,&mdash;and then take their labour
upon the reduced scale paid out of the rates; thus
entailing upon his neighbours a share of the
expenses of his own establishment. In many
parishes <i>every</i> labourer was a pauper.</p>

<p>At the same time, capitalists and stock-jobbers
were amassing wealth, in an unprecedented degree;
whilst more than a million sterling, annually, was
diverted from the public resources, into the pockets
of sinecurists. All the idleness and luxury, thus
created, helped to augment the price of the necessaries
of life; and the inevitable consequences of
unproductive expenditure ensued, in a continued
diminution of the resources of those persons who
earned their living.</p>

<p>And what was the <i>bolus</i>, proposed to be applied
for the cure of this alarming cancer? <i>Educate the
children of the poor!</i> Positively! As though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
children of the poor (at least, of the rural poor) did
not pick up their education day by day, from
the moment that they could crawl out into the
fields to scare away the rooks; as though ploughing,
mowing, threshing, and reaping,&mdash;loading a
waggon, and guiding a team, could not be better
acquired, on the old lines, than by having the unreceptive
bucolic brain first gorged with reading,
writing, and arithmetic! And this new reforming
agency, mark you, was to be a further expense to
the rate-payers; already at their wits’ end to know
how, themselves, to keep the wolf from the door.
Is it any wonder, then, that persons who, like Mr.
Cobbett, not only knew the real wants and temptations,
and difficulties of the labourer, raised their
voices indignantly?</p>

<p>That it should be imputed to the poor, that it
was their <span class="smcapuc">IGNORANCE</span> and <span class="smcapuc">VICE</span> which had brought
them low: that any other cause, but the increase
of luxurious idlers, and the draining of the national
resources by exorbitant taxation, could lie at the
root of the evil: that a generation of plutocrats
should have grown up, who looked upon the “lower
orders” as of less consequence than their horses,
their dogs, and their poultry, was not to be borne
in silence, whilst the pen of a ready writer was at
hand to defy such thoughtless misrepresentation.</p>

<p>From this time, then, until the period of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
death, Cobbett’s voice was raised on behalf of the
suffering Labouring Classes of England. An
adequate return for their labour, and some respect
toward them as fellow-creatures, he was determined
to get; and he would suffer no opposition,
no ignominy, to hinder his endeavours.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, what was his own practice; and what was
the condition of the labourers in his own service?</p>

<p>Precisely that, which could alone render them
independent and prosperous. He would have no
paupers; and, although they were, generally,
married men with families, no one was allowed
to remain in his service who required parish assistance.
As he gave high wages, and provided
them with a free dwelling, the need of this stipulation
is obvious. But, they had to work for it
all: Mr. Cobbett would have a day’s work for a
day’s pay; and so have no obligation left, on
either side, when they came to eventide. Men
might be independent, and they might be saucy,
too; but better these, a thousand times, than
cringing hypocrisy,&mdash;than the enslavement of idleness
at starvation-pay.</p>

<p>Not only this: Mr. Cobbett’s was a measure full

<p>Seventy years will pass away, and carry off
with them most direct evidence, leaving little
beyond shadowy traditions. But there are, yet
living at Botley, aged persons who were long in
Mr. Cobbett’s service, as gardeners and farm-labourers.
And these persons, one and all, represent
his days at Botley as a time of exceptional
comfort and well-being; and his service as one
of well-paid, hard-working earnestness. Hated and
envied by some of his neighbours, he was maligned,
and abused, and misrepresented, as earnest people
always are;<a name="FNanchor_11_19" id="FNanchor_11_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_19" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> but there were a far greater number,
who welcomed the current of joy, and freedom, to
which he had given rise. And the recollection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of his name will still restore a transient smile to the
withered features of a man, whose lengthened
span of life may be due, in great measure, to the
habits of industry and thrift and independence
acquired in the service of William Cobbett.</p>

faithful as it is graphic. The event provided ample resource for the
witlings of the day. See, for example, “A History of the Westminster
Election in November, 1806,” with its coloured picture of
the hustings; also, “The Rising Sun; a Serio-comic Satiric Romance,”
vol. ii., in which Paull’s bottle-holder appears as <i>Mr.

Political Proteus: a view of the Character and Conduct of R. B.
Sheridan, Esq.,” &amp;c., and published by Budd and others. Sheridan’s
“dramatic loyalty” (as it was happily expressed), was a constant
theme of the caricaturists of the day. Cobbett makes a note,
in one of his “summaries,” of twenty-five public pledges which
Sheridan had abandoned, and promises that they shall be “detailed
one of these days.”</p>

a duel, in which both were wounded. The affair was a rather silly
one, and brought out some wit. Mr. Paull was a little, fiery man,
or he would have succeeded better as a politician. Mr. Horne Tooke
said to him one day, “You are a bold man, and I am certain you’ll
succeed; only, as Cobbett says, <i>keep yourself cool</i>.”</p>

which arose in the <i>Register</i> early in 1807. Mr. Cobbett was out of
his sphere on this topic, and his correspondents (who were at all
humorous) saw a ready application of the fable concerning a fox who
had lost his tail. Others were more serious, and thought that the
knowledge of the Latin and Greek classics “kept together the
higher orders of society, and separate from the lower orders.”</p>

had remarkably low and narrow views concerning the <i>lower orders</i>
of his own country, as he called them. In 1801, he “nearly

relief! At another time he thinks Government should relieve, privately,
some of the distress, “and afterwards allege that they did
not do so publicly for fear of producing a mischievous effect abroad.”

people “tainted” with disaffection, when everybody knows they are

1790, and became an adherent of Mr. Fox, after whose death he
was one of the principal leaders of opposition. A genuine philanthropist,
guided by deep religious impressions, he spent a large portion
of his wealth in endeavouring to ameliorate the condition of the
poor, in and around his Bedfordshire estates.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_19" id="Footnote_11_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_19"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> On one occasion, in the summer of 1809, there was a grand
field-day over “Cobbett, the Oppressor of the Poor,” &amp;c., &amp;c. A
boy in his service had absconded, after having received his wages
beforehand; and, being brought before the magistrates at Winchester,
was sent to prison for a week. But, through some informality
on the part of the constable who arrested him, the relatives
of the boy were induced to bring an action against Cobbett, the
constable, and another local officer, the damages being laid at one
thousand pounds! The papers were, instantly, full of the affair;
several columns appeared in the <i>Post</i>, to the exclusion of important
war news; Gillray had a picture of the oppressor thrashing
the naked boy tied to a post; women of fashion came to see the
poor creature in prison. The three defendants had to pay ten
pounds between them; and the fact of <i>a conviction</i> was sufficient for
exulting detractors. The boy afterwards admitted, however, that he
ran away from Mr. Cobbett’s because he had to get up as early as
his master.
</p>
<p>
“In private life Mr. Cobbett is an exceedingly pleasant companion,
and an excellent husband and father. It has been asserted
that he is harsh to those who are in his service, but this appears to
me to be a calumny. That he expects his labourers to perform
their duty is certain, and in this he is truly their friend. Industrious
himself, he hates idleness in others. But he is willing to pay them
liberally, and to contribute to their happiness. I have been more
than once at Botley, and must say that I have never anywhere seen
such excellent cottages, gardens, and other comforts appropriated to
the labouring class as those which he erected and laid out on his
estate.”&mdash;(From “Public Characters of All Nations,” Sir R. Phillips,
Lond., 1823).
</p>
<p>
Alexander Somerville once met with a former Botley servant of
Cobbett’s, who declared that he “would never wish to serve a better
master.” (“The Whistler at the Plough,” p. 263, Lond., 1852).</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">“THEY NATURALLY HATE ME.”</span></h2>

<p>There was a Mr. Homan, M.P., a friend of
Sheridan’s, and a defender of his reputation, who
came down to the House of Commons, one day in
the Session of 1807, and announced that a friend
of his had just called upon Mr. Cobbett, at Botley;
and found him living in a “pig-stye.” Now, this
gentle sally, on the part of a jocular senator, may
be selected (out of many, more or less serious) in
order to indicate the prominent place now occupied
by Cobbett in men’s minds. Addressing with
familiarity the leading characters of the day,
(always in the first-person-singular, be it remembered),
he is herding with, and advocating the
cause of, the lowest of the low. Occupied with
such vulgar pursuits as gardening and planting,
and tending dogs and pigs, he is actually daring
to instruct and to lead the successors of Burke and
of Pitt. One of the “swinish multitude” is here,
having poked his nose through the crowd, strutting
along cheek-by-jowl with cabinet ministers, and
positively claiming a share of the foot-way!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The worst of it all is, that this presumptuous
fellow is not in the wrong. Nobody can convict
him of a misstatement of facts; no one can answer
his arguments; no one can match his brilliant
language. Yet, people won’t leave him alone:
they will put their pop-guns into range; they
will throw dirt, unmindful of the consequences of
handling dirt. And, these failing,&mdash;as the passionate
schoolboy, unable to wreak his vengeance
openly, for just castigation, sneaks;&mdash;they sneak.
They watch his footsteps, if so he can be tripped-up.</p>

<p>But the intended victim learns wariness as he
proceeds. Who should be tripped-up, that plants
one foot securely before the other is raised? that
gives chapter-and-verse for his facts? that dreads
no bogy whatsoever? and who still wants to know
so many interesting little secrets, which he has a
perfect right to know, and which he is determined
to know?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Several opposition papers had already been
tried, previously to this date. The Addington
ministry set up <i>The Pilot</i>, and the <i>Royal Standard</i>;
but these soon died</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Unwept, unhonour’d, and unsung,”</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and are, probably, only rescued from utter oblivion
by this sternly-truthful page. An imitation <i>Register</i>,
edited by Mr. <span class="smcap">Redhead Yorke</span>,<a name="FNanchor_1_20" id="FNanchor_1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_20" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
longer lease of life;&mdash;known as <i>Yorke’s Weekly
Political Review</i>, the first number appeared in
November, 1805, and ran to several volumes.
But it never attained to any authority. <i>Flower’s
Political Review and Monthly Register</i>, printed at
Harlow, lasted several years. This journal gave
a mild sort of support to reform, without extravagance
of tone; and reprinted, from time to time,
such works as “Locke on Government,” and
Bolingbroke’s “Patriot King.”</p>

<p>Later on, appeared the <i>National Register</i>, with
the openly-avowed object of producing “candid,
but intrepid strictures” upon Mr. Cobbett and
the political pamphleteers. And in 1809, a very
grand show was made, in the prospectus of
<span class="smcap">Blagdon’s</span> <i>Weekly Political Register</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This new political paper will be printed in the same
manner as <span class="smcap">Cobbett’s Register</span>.</p>

<p>“In every number will be inserted an exposition of the
daring libels and audacious falsehoods promulgated by
<span class="smcap">Cobbett</span>.</p>

<p>“All who are acquainted with the paper of <span class="smcap">Cobbett</span>,
may perfectly understand the nature of the one here proposed,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The history of the political life and writings of
<span class="smcap">William Cobbett</span> will be commenced in the first
number, and continued every week, till concluded.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such a very funny prospectus: such a marvel
of self-sufficiency, ignorance, and malignity: really
should have been supported better. But, no!
people didn’t want to be told afresh, that misgovernment
ought to be hushed up for the sake
of great reputations; and Mr. Blagdon disappeared,
along with all the other political dolphins, that
must need display their back-fins for one transient
moment, with no other end than to whet curiosity
or excite wonder.</p>

<p>Some of the pamphlets fared better. But then,
they were freely distributed by the agents of
Government. The story of the Court-Martial,
published in 1809, was understood to be an open
effort, on the part of ministers and their adherents,
to damage the honour of Mr. Cobbett: indeed, it
could not have been otherwise, seeing the amount
of official matter which the thing contained.<a name="FNanchor_2_21" id="FNanchor_2_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_21" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Besides a half-crown edition, it was issued in a
cheap form for distribution.</p>

<p>Then there was “Cobbett Convicted, and the
Revolutionist Exposed:” a task of no great difficulty,
of course,&mdash;seeing that it was “The Parlia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>mentary
Reformer” brought face to face with old
“Peter Porcupine,” the hater of demagogues and the
denouncer of revolution. A kindred publication
was “Elements of Reform,” sold at sixpence, and
largely distributed amongst the people; so that
they might see for themselves how excessively
wrong, how truly inconsistent, it was, for any
person to change his opinions when he got older
and wiser.</p>

<p>One of the most curious evidences of the spirit of
persecution, which was abroad among ministerialists,
is furnished by Lord Colchester, under date May
7th, 1809.<a name="FNanchor_3_22" id="FNanchor_3_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_22" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He was at that time “Mr. Speaker,”
and was walking home after church with Mr. Perceval.
The latter, communicating his thoughts on
various topics, at last comes to Cobbett:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He thought Cobbett had at last committed himself
in his paper upon the House of Commons’ vote (for
rejecting Lord Folkestone’s motion for a Committee to
inquire into the sale of all places in the State, &amp;c.), but,
when he showed me the paper, it did not so strike me
that the libel was more violent than what all the opposition
papers contained every day; nor was it such as could
usefully be proceeded upon.”</p>

</div>

<p>What Mr. Cobbett had said, you will find in the
<i>Register</i> of the previous day. And, if you think
that the word “libellous” applies to his remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>s, you
have leave to bring a charge of assault and battery
against that man, who has violated the sanctity
of your mouth, in withdrawing therefrom the
tooth which distressed you, and which embittered
your existence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing notes, somewhat anticipatory in
point of time, will enable the reader to understand
the danger which was now attending Mr. Cobbett’s
footsteps. He was running the gauntlet of all
those who had anything to fear from too much
light; and they naturally hated him. Not that he
was alone: the Reformists were increasing in
number. But Mr. Cobbett was the most daring of
the lot; inspiring all the rest with pluck and animation.
Even in the House of Commons, the
division lists showed how a feeling of shame was
growing upon a greater number of its members.
As early as 1807, a Reversion Bill passed the
Commons, the object of which was to prevent the
future granting of sinecure places <i>two or three deep</i>;
this was, however, thrown out in the Lords.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And all this did not interrupt the joys down in
Hampshire:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… I have the finest melons, Indian corn, and
Carolina beans that ever were seen.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We are just setting out to meet Mr. Bagshaw,<a name="FNanchor_4_23" id="FNanchor_4_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_23" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
as a proof of our having anticipated your hopes about
amusing him, we have made all the preparations for taking
him with us to Morn Hill Fair to-morrow, which is upon
the heights above Winchester, and which is the greatest
fair, for one day, that is known in England. There are
several scores of acres of ground covered over with bacon,
cheese, hops, leather, &amp;c. About Wednesday he will go
to Portsmouth.”</p>

<p>“I hope soon to send hares to everybody. I have
killed some, and have, as usual, given them away. I take
my young bitch to Everley, where she is to run a match
that Dr. Mitford has made; but I shall leave betting and
matches to others, though I cannot say but I should like
to see my dogs win.”<a name="FNanchor_5_24" id="FNanchor_5_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_24" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hares and post-offices do not congregate together, I
find. There is none of the latter nearer to Everley than
this place [Andover, November, 1807].… I am now
starting for Everley with Nancy, Mrs. Cobbett having
declined the trip. She will go to Dr. Mitford’s. I saw
William at Winchester, who is grown very much, and who
behaved just as a son of mine ought to behave. So
cleanly, so orderly, so attentive, so punctual, and so
manly, just as I was at his age; I hope the qualities will
be more durable with him.”</p>

<p>“… Almost all the money I draw is expended in
preparations for planting, and in making a new footpath
along the side of my farm, in order to stop up the one
that passes through it, and which is an injury to the
estate. These pecuniary pinches give me great uneasiness,
at times; but they will cease before it be long; and
if it please God to preserve my life, they will cease much
about the time that my grand planting scheme will be
actually completed. There is here a little coppice, which
I think will be to be sold; and which I intend you shall
have.… I am very desirous that you should have an
inch of land that you might set your foot upon, and say,
‘this is mine.’ But pray never talk to any one about these
matters.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>. Wright is particularly requested not to lend
the little mare, but to make use of it himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I hope you ride a good deal. I wish to God you
would rise early. It is the finest thing in the world for
health. I am in my coppice by six o’clock in the morning;
but then, I am in bed by ten at latest.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following occurs, as a postscript, on the back
of a letter to Wright:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My dear little James,&mdash;your little dog is very well,
and the rabbits are in their new house. God bless you.&mdash;Wm.
C.”</p>

</div>

<p>An old acquaintance turns up, one day in the
spring of 1808:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This day the most wonderful thing, which I have
met with in my whole wonderful life, has happened to
me. A gentleman came to me this morning from
London, to show me, and to consult me upon, the publication
of a work upon <i>Metaphysicks</i>. He appeared to be
a very learned and very accomplished man, and so I find
him, upon some hours of conversation; and, would you
believe it, he then discovered himself to me; and I found
him to be the same whom I left in England, twenty-three
years ago, a fifer, in the recruiting party that I belonged
to! This has occupied me the whole day. He was
about two years younger than myself, and I have thought
and talked of him ten thousand times, having had a most
affectionate regard for him.… You shall see my old
acquaintance when I get to town.”</p>

</div>

<p>Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>e letters of this period are filled with cautions,
that every means be taken to avoid occasion of real
offence. “Copy” for the <i>Register</i> is to be carefully
scanned, and communications from sympathizing
correspondents are to be softened in their tone,
before committal to the printer. Some of these
latter are far too plain-spoken. An awakened
public opinion, too liable to rush to extremes,
must be kept within proper limits, as regards its
expression. There is no disposition to go to jail
for the sake of brilliant periods and caustic paragraphs.
The “villains” could be lashed vigorously
enough without any need of departing from facts.</p>

<p>Questions of libel were by no means infrequent,
during these years. And, with Lord Ellenborough’s
severe opinions on that topic, there was plenty
of reason to fear any conflict with authority. An
action brought by an offended author against
Messrs. Hood and Sharpe, in July 1808, for a skit
upon a certain book of travels, brought Mr. Cobbett
forward, in several letters upon the subject of
libel law; in which he pointed out very clearly,
that principles had retrograded since the days
of Pope and Swift, who certainly had no idea that
to write and publish truth was any crime:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The whole tenor of their works proves, that, so long
as they confined themselves to the stating of what was
<i>true</i>, they entertained no apprehensions as to the consequences.…
They were afraid of no constructive libels;
nor, if they chose to express their disapprobation of the
conduct of kings and princes, did they fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> the accusation
of <i>disloyalty</i>. And what would they have said, had they
been told that, in their country, it would become a crime
to wound men’s feelings by holding them up to ridicule?
Ridicule is a thing that will not attach <i>where it ought not</i>,”
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>His own idea (which, however, he did not always
put into practice) was to live it down; and, as for
calumny, he had advised Mr. Paull, and he had so
advised others, to let falsehood come to the inevitable
over-reaching of itself.</p>

<p>As for caricatures,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Caricatures are things to laugh at. They break no
bones. I, for instance, have been represented as a bulldog,
as a porcupine, as a wolf, as a sans-culotte, as a
nightman, as a bear, as a kite, as a cur; and, in America,
as hanging upon a gallows. Yet, here I am, just as sound
as if no misrepresentation of me had ever been made.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was no idle boast. The Anti-Cobbett
squibs and caricatures were a standing source
of amusement, even with the little boys and girls,
at Botley house. The articles, above alluded to,
had produced a fresh crop. He writes to Mr.
Wright upon “our friends the satirists:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They seem half-distracted. How angry they are,
that I did not take notice of what they said of myself!
All those who know anything of me, know their assertions
or insinuations to be false; and, as to those who know
nothing of me, they are of no consequence to me, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
anybody else.”</p>

</div>

<p>But, the jealousy of the press was beyond everything.<a name="FNanchor_6_25" id="FNanchor_6_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_25" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Unfairness and malignity marked all
references to Cobbett, who was really doing them
better service than any one individual, beside, could
be credited with. It is true, he never spared his
cotemporaries, when in fight; but let them be for
a moment in trouble, and his shield was at once
raised, by his proclamation of the Liberty of the
Press; and of his doctrine that there was nothing
so mean, “nor so truly detestable,” as that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
seeking, through the law, vengeance for a literary
defeat. No such generosity, however, could be
remembered in the midst of party fights; and,
even where there was real ability and talent, as
with the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> under James Perry,
newspaper polemics of that day were marked by
misrepresentation and abuse.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The inquiry into the conduct of the Duke of
York, brought about by the discovery of corrupt
influence in the disposal of promotions, &amp;c., kept
society amused for several months, during the year
1809; and, indeed, threw everything else into the
shade, not excepting the new tide of affairs in the
Peninsula. Mr. Cobbett was in the front, as might
have been expected.</p>

<p>The circumstances were these. The Duke of
York had now been the Commander-in-Chief for
several years, to the great benefit of the service.
It was generally acknowledged that increased
efficiency and discipline had been introduced into
the army since his appointment. Yet, whispers
had begun to be circulated, conveying grave insinuations
against his Royal Highness; and there
were those who openly predicted his speedy
dismissal.</p>

<p>All this was, however, treated by “the loyal”
as wicked conspiracy, libel, Jacobinism, and so
forth. And the Duke might have escaped exposu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>re,
had it not been for a brave Irishman, who
ventured upon publishing his grievances,<a name="FNanchor_7_26" id="FNanchor_7_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_26" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and
risking the inevitable dangers. As it happened,
Major Hogan’s pamphlet came just in the nick
of time, gave the Duke’s enemies an opportunity,
and the Reformists a grievance. Here is Mr.
Cobbett’s first short reference, directing public
attention to it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This, I scruple not to say, is the most interesting
publication that has appeared in England for many years.
It should be read by every individual in the nation. Oh,
what a story does this gentleman tell! What a picture
does he exhibit! What facts does he unfold! If <i>this</i>
produce no effect upon the public, why, then, we are so
base and rascally a crew, that it is no matter what becomes
of us. We are unworthy of the name of men, and are
beneath the beasts that perish.”</p>

</div>

<p>The facts being, in short, that Major Hogan
found he could get the promotion he wanted by
paying 500<i>l.</i> to the Duke’s mistress, Mrs. Clarke;
after he had waited long and hopelessly for it, on
direct application to the Duke himself.</p>

<p>There was some hesitation in accepting Major
Hogan’s statement; meanwhile, Finnerty, who had
edited the pamphlet, and the publisher, Bags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>haw,
were prosecuted. Mr. Cobbett, himself, thought
the story far too gross to be true,&mdash;that a “peculating
pimp,” (as he called her), had gone round
to the major’s hotel with hush-money: had been
refused: and that such doubtful personage could
be no other than the artful mistress of the Prince.
However, light came upon the matter from another
quarter, which laid the whole thing before the
public gaze; and, in the end, caused the temporary
retirement of the Duke from his office.</p>

<p>Mr. Gwyllym Lloyd Wardle<a name="FNanchor_8_27" id="FNanchor_8_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_27" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was the agent of
inquiry. He brought the matter before the House
of Commons, in January, 1809, supported by
several clear instances; in which it was shown that
Mrs. Clarke was having a large share in the
patronage of the War Office, and was making a
good deal of money over it; besides, that several
clergymen owed their advancement to her. So,
there was a Committee of the whole House; many
witnesses were examined,&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">and the faithful Commons could attend to nothing
whilst this was going on. Corunna faded into
insignificance, and became a mocking sound; and
no one seemed to think that the war was of any
consequence, until this interesting affair was disposed
of.<a name="FNanchor_9_28" id="FNanchor_9_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_28" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The upshot of all was, that the Duke of York
was exculpated from any guilty participation in
these malpractices; but he at once resigned the
office of commander-in-chief, and dismissed the
author of his troubles.</p>

<p>Colonel Wardle was publicly thanked for his
disinterested service, in all the principal towns in
the kingdom. He did not escape malignity however;
and his popularity on the one hand was
balanced by persecution on the other, headed
by Mrs. Clarke herself. After the lapse of a
year or so, she produced a very naughty, brazen-faced
book, under the title of “The Rival Princes;”<a name="FNanchor_10_29" id="FNanchor_10_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_29" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
in which most of the gentlemen who had aided in
exposing her were more or less libelled. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
book that could only have been produced by a
courtesan, and it, probably, did not do any harm
either to Colonel Wardle, or to any of those whose
names were involved. Mr. Cobbett’s name appears
in it, as having been incited to anger against
the Duke, on account of the latter having thought
it prudent not to receive Cobbett at dinner, as an
opposition writer. Mr. Cobbett thereupon informed
his public that he had been introduced to
Mrs. Clarke, and was invited to dine with her; but
that his wife disapproved of any such questionable
acquaintance, and he didn’t go.<a name="FNanchor_11_30" id="FNanchor_11_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_30" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>It is exceedingly probable that the Royal
Family were getting offended with Mr. Cobbett, in
spite of his professions of loyalty to the constitution,
and his really affectionate references to the
king; and it would surprise no one, at this
distance of time, to learn that the Prince of Wales
and Mr. Perceval were putting their heads t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>ogether
with a view to silencing him. That which brought
Mr. Cobbett into the one great trouble of his life
happened soon after the above-mentioned events.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5_24" id="Footnote_5_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_24"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Here are reminiscences of Everley, written nearly twenty years
after:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Not far above Amesbury is a little village called Netheravon,
where I once saw <i>an acre of hares</i>. We were coursing at Everley,
a few miles off, and one of the party happening to say that he had
seen <i>an acre of hares</i> at Mr. Hicks-Beach’s at Netheravon, we who
wanted to see the same, or to detect our informant, sent a messenger
to beg a day’s coursing, which being granted, we went over the next
day. Mr. Beach received us very politely. He took us into a
wheat stubble close to his paddock; his son took a gallop round,
cracking his whip at the same time; the hares (which were very
thickly in sight before) started all over the field, ran into a flock
like sheep, and we all agreed that the flock did cover an acre of
ground.”
</p>
<p>
“This is the most famous place in all England for coursing. I
was here, at this very inn, with a party eighteen years ago; and the
landlord, who is still the same, recognized me as soon as he saw me.
There were forty brace of greyhounds taken out into the field on one
of the days, and every brace had one course, and some of them <i>two</i>.
The ground is the finest in the world: from two to three miles for
the hare to run to cover, and not a stone, nor a bush, nor a hillock.
It was here proved to me that the hare is by far the swiftest of all
English animals; for I saw three hares in one day <i>run away</i> from
the dogs. To give dog and hare a fair trial, there should be but <i>one</i>
dog; then, if that dog got so close as to compel the hare <i>to turn</i>,
that would be a proof that the dog ran fastest. When the dog, or
dogs, never get near enough to the hare to induce her to turn, she is
said, and very justly, to run away from them; and, as I saw three
hares do this in one day, I conclude that the hare is the swifter
animal of the two.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_25" id="Footnote_6_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_25"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The first genuine piece of criticism upon Cobbett’s writings,
which had any real talent, was an article by Francis Jeffery in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> for July, 1807. But it had the same conspicuous
failure which attended all partisan writers, and Whigs above all, in
their efforts to define political consistency.
</p>
<p>
This article furnished the material out of which all subsequent
attacks upon Cobbett’s alleged “tergiversation” would seem to
have been founded. While, however, there was abundant material
for comparison, there was no impugning the justness of his reasons
for a change of views; nor, indeed, was any attempt made to do so.
Both Jeffery and his copiers studiously avoided arguing out Cobbett’s
conclusions. It was all-sufficient, in the eye of a party writer, to
wreck a man’s reputation who had once openly forsaken a cause.
</p>
<p>
And yet, the reviewer, near the opening of his article, says the
<i>Register</i> “can only be acceptable to men of some vigour of intellect,
and some independence of principle.” That was the very root of
the matter. Imagine the <i>Edinburgh</i> of that day being acceptable to
men of any independence of principle! The very number in question
has an article on Catholic Relief, which not only contains sentiments
differing from Jeffery’s, but the very opposite to those
enunciated by the same review only three years before.
</p>
<p>
But there was one leading difference between the Whig writer
and Mr. Cobbett&mdash;they were place-hunters and he was not, and no
awkward “comparisons” could wipe out this notorious fact.</p>

had served in Ireland during the rebellion; he entered Parliament,
as Member for Oakhampton, in the year 1807. This affair of the
Duke of York brought him vast popularity.
</p>
<p>
Francis Place says that Colonel Wardle was a weak and timid
man, without the capacity to estimate either his own powers or
resources, and that, had he foreseen the trouble and vexation his
motion would have occasioned him, he would not have made it.
Mr. Brooks (another Westminster politician) raised a subscription of
4000<i>l.</i> for Wardle. See Place MSS. in the British Museum (Addl.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">“THE OUTCRY AGAINST ME IS LOUDER THAN
EVER.”</span></h2>

<p>The little estate, which was being formed on the
banks of the Hamble, was now beginning to wear
a face of its own, in the spring of 1808. The consolidation
of two or three small farms, and the replanting
of a large portion of the ground, with oak,
thorn, ash, acacia, &amp;c., was the outline of a plan,
which now showed some promise of a return. Mr.
Cobbett’s favourite notion had been, that a fair
provision for his family might be thus made. And
now, after three full seasons, the new plantations
had entirely fulfilled the expectation.<a name="FNanchor_1_31" id="FNanchor_1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_31" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> They were
flourishing and healthy, and a large supply of
material for the London stick-makers appears as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
part of this year’s cropping. In May, there is
another large parcel of land added, containing
sixty-seven acres of wood, besides arable land and
water-meadow.</p>

<p>All this makes the need of any visit to London
still more irksome; and Mr. Wright has to do the
honours for his leader. There is talk of a grand
demonstration at Westminster, to celebrate the
anniversary of Burdett’s election; but Mr. Cobbett
doesn’t care to be dragged away from his beloved
fields into “the cursed smoke,” as he calls it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… Go to the committee by all means. Let us
suffer no little slights to interfere with our public duty.
That is the way with those only who are actuated by
selfish motives. I shall be in town on Thursday night
next, or on Saturday night.… If I find all to be good
men and true, we will make such a stir as has not for
sometime been made. All the gentlemen whom I meet
with, are loud in Sir Francis Burdett’s praise. The
motion about the cashiering of offices has gained him
thousands of valuable friends. So bent was I upon calling
for a purgation of that d&mdash;&mdash; House, that I was resolved
to petition alone, if any one would have presented my
petition. The nation is heart-sick of it. It is impossible
for both factions united to calumniate our motives, if we
proceed as we ought, and do not mix with men of bad
character. There is one Hunt,<a name="FNanchor_2_32" id="FNanchor_2_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_32" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the Bristol man.
Beware of him. He rides about the country with a * *
the wife of another man, having deserted his own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> A sad
fellow! Nothing to do with him.</p>

<p>“P.S.&mdash;I will write to Sir J. Astley. I am very sorry
for his misfortune indeed. I want very much to see
some man who has planted upon a large scale. Cutting
upon a large scale is the order of the day here.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“… Now, as to the dinner, it is dreadfully distressing
for me to go; for, the season being so backward,
has thrown the oak-cutting into this week and the two
succeeding ones, and you will easily guess how necessary
my personal attendance is, while it lasts. Yet I will go, if
alive and well; but I must go up on the Sunday, and come
back on the Tuesday, for I cannot be longer absent. I
have many reasons for going as well as for staying; but
the former prevail.</p>

<p>“I have not sold my second lot of timber that I had
marked while I was in London. When I come to see it
again, and to consider that the 300 that would have sold
for a thousand pounds were gaining in growth above 150<i>l.</i>
a year, I could not bring myself to commit such flagrant
murder of property. The new purchase has upon it
about 6000 trees, that now cost me from a shilling to
two-and-sixpence apiece, and that in twenty years’ time
will be worth 3<i>l.</i> apiece, at the very least. This, I think,
is the best way of insuring a fortune for children.”</p>

<p>“Only the day before yesterday, I was bent upon going
to town for the 23rd, and had written to Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; of
Fontington, to meet me there about the farm. But now
I find that it cannot be, without an inconvenience and
risk which, I am sure, no friend would wish me to in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>cur,
especially as my journey would produce little more than
my own gratification at witnessing the assemblage of so
many public-spirited men. You know very well that this
is my harvest, and that this year I have a tenfold harvest.
I allude to the oak-tree cutting, which must be done while
the sap is in the flood of its spring, or not at all; and the
bark, you will observe, is of the little thinners that I am
cutting upon my own account, worth three times as much
as the timber. In the average of years, this sap season
lasts a good month; but the very extraordinary backwardness
of this spring, and the very rare hot weather
that has come on after it, has made the season last only
three weeks, a fortnight of which has already passed.
Owing to this, I, who waited till the several companies
of fellers had finished the great timber, am obliged to
fall to work on Saturday, instead of waiting till next
Tuesday. I am compelled to set sixty men on at once,
and as mine is a work of thinning, it will require my constant
attendance from the time the men begin till they
leave off. I must be with them to mark the trees; to see
the effect of taking out some, before we take out others;
and, in short, the health and growth, as well as the future
beauty, of 100 acres of the finest woods in England
depend upon my personal attendance between Saturday
and Wednesday next. Nothing ever was more pointedly
perverse; but I trust that all those who wished me to
attend the dinner will be convinced that I ought not to
leave home at this time.</p>

<p>“I am of opinion, too (and I should like to hear what
the Major says of the matter), that I am of most weight
as a <i>spectator</i> and <i>comment-maker</i>. This way my word
and opinion pass for a good deal; but I am not clear
that whatever good I could do as an <i>agitator</i>, would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
be more than counterbalanced by the loss of weight in
the other character. I know it is the opinion of Sir
Francis, that to put me in parliament would be to lessen
my weight; and, really, I think that the same reasoning
will apply to the other case. In fact, we cannot <i>act</i> and
<i>write</i> too, with so much advantage. The way in which I
am most able to aid the cause of the country is to sit
quietly here, and give my sincere and unbiased opinions
upon all that passes which appears worthy of particular
notice.</p>

<p>“In the copy last sent you, there is the phrase ‘<i>old</i> G.
Rose.’ Upon second thoughts, it may as well be left
out. It is, perhaps, right to cease to use that, and the
like phrases. One puts them down under the influence
of indignant feelings, but they probably do more harm
than good.”</p>

</div>

<p>Although he does not go up to the festival at
the “Crown and Anchor,” Mr. Cobbett does justice
to the opportunity as a “comment-maker.” In
supporting Burdett’s views, as expressed at the
meeting, he remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am persuaded that if the nation were polled, leaving
out those who have an interest in corruption, there would
appear a majority of a thousand to one in favour of the
reform, which he recommends, and which, in their better
days, had been recommended by Mr. Pitt and Mr.
Wilberforce.… A minister may desire to do that which
is for the good of the country; he may have an anxious
desire to promote its happiness (and, his errors aside, I
do think that Mr. Perceval is such a man); but, before he
can stir an inch, he has the feelings and interests of th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>e
borough-mongers to consult; he has party to counteract,
and faction to mollify. How much more at his ease must
such a man feel: what a load would be removed from his
mind, if he could step into a House of Commons freely
chosen, and having no object in view but that of agreeing
to what they thought good, and opposing what they
thought bad! A House of Commons in which there
would be no strife for office or emolument, and in which,
nine times out of ten, truth would prevail.”</p>

</div>

<p>There is an excursion to Cornwall, in August,
on occasion of the trial of Sir Christopher Hawkins
and others, at Penrhyn, for corrupt practices at a
past election. The electors of Westminster are
forthwith treated to a new lecture, upon the prevalence
of the “vile traffic” in seats; and Mr.
Wright is favoured with an account of the aspect
of things and people as they appear from behind
the scenes. One remark is interesting: “Notwithstanding
all I have said about the lawyers
lately, the whole of them have treated me with
distinguished civility.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following, dated 17th September, 1808, is
worth preserving, as upon a subject concerning
which Mr. Cobbett had some real practical knowledge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The essay upon planting, which you sent me some
time ago, is very well done, and is particularly interesting
to me. It establishes, from experience, what I had before
made up my mind to, in theory. Certainly, there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
way in which the very best lands are to be employed to
so much ultimate advantage. If your friend should be
actually about planting himself, my experiments, in a year
or two, may be of great use to him. Of two things, however,
I can now speak with positive certainty; viz., that
to obtain quick produce, the trees planted should be
small; deciduous trees from the seed-bed, and firs not
above a foot or eighteen inches high. And, that all
deciduous trees, of whatever size, should be, after planting,
cut down to the ground. Last year (March, 1807),
I planted ten planes, about eight feet high. Some of them
shot very well, others not, their tops dying, and the new
shoots breaking out some distance from the branches.
One of them, in the month of May, 1807, we thought was
dead; but my man, thinking that there was some life in
the root, cut it off within two inches of the ground.…
This tree is now twelve feet high, a beautiful straight
stem, with proper side-branches, while the highest of the
others (with heads too large for their bodies) is not more
than ten feet high. I have proved the same with all
sorts of deciduous trees. Those who want, quickly, fine
plantations about their houses, should plant and cut down
to the ground; and of course those should do it who
plant for profit. If this were done, you would not see so
many acres of poor, sickly, dead-topped things, called
shrubberies, about new-built houses. A tree planted
large, and its head left on, is a continual eyesore, until it
be rooted up. I transplanted some American walnuts
last March; they were three feet high in the seed-bed.
Some I cut down before I planted them, the rest not;
and the former are now as high as the latter, with fine
straight stems, while the others are top-heavy, and must
be cut down at last, in order to make them grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
freely.…</p>

<p>“The rascals in Portugal have made a pretty mess of
it! To be sure, one cannot say how they have been
criminal; but to me it appears that both our admiral
and our general ought to be hanged.…”</p>

</div>

<p>This last paragraph refers to the convention at
Cintra, by which the French army was permitted
to retire from Portugal in British ships. This advantage,
granted to the ubiquitous enemy, caused
a great popular outcry in England. The Hampshire
people had a grand demonstration at Winchester,
in November; in which occasion Mr.
Cobbett took a prominent part.</p>

<p>Another useful scheme is now in preparation.
In his reading, necessitated by the production of
the “Parliamentary History,” Mr. Cobbett had
found the need of an accessible edition of the State
Trials; and he resolved to supply the want by
reproducing them, with additional matter, in the
belief that other students of history would find it
of advantage. Mr. Wright entered warmly into the
notion, and procured the services of a gentleman to
act as editor. This was Thomas Bayly Howell,
whose name has sometimes been associated with
the work.<a name="FNanchor_3_33" id="FNanchor_3_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_33" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But there seems to have early arisen
some dissatisfaction with him, and the engagement
went very near to be cancelled. The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
has the first of several references to this matter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Enclosed is a letter for you to read, and then send.
I cannot consent to a partnership. Upon reading my
letter, you will see what difficulties it must lead to. Only
think of having another person invested with a right, a legal
right, to make us account,&mdash;<i>us</i>, whose accounts the devil
himself would never unravel. I would not take such a
weight upon my mind for all the profits of all the books
in the universe. No, no: you and I were never made
to have our accounts examined by anybody but ourselves.
Besides, you know what <i>all</i> authors are. They are all
impatient for sale. But I need say no more. My letter
will adjust everything, I am certain.…</p>

<p>“… I thank you for the caricature. One would suppose
that I had given the hint myself, and, indeed, I am
afraid the town will say so. But, d&mdash;&mdash; the town! I
care not what it says or thinks of me.… We shall
have, I think, a blazing meeting at Winchester, and I
have written to Finnerty to come down. Mind Deverell.
Never say anything to him that you do not wish the world
to know. He is a trading politician,&mdash;a mere party agent.
I have several letters from very respectable men in the
county intimating their wish to join me; particularly
from Mr. Lowth (a son of Bishop Lowth), a man of great
property, and not less respectability.…</p>

<p>“… William writes me a letter every week, copies a
page of the history of England every day, reads my part
of the <i>Register</i> every week, and is to get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>s far as the
Rule of Three, complete, by Christmas. He rode from
school to Weyhill Fair, and back, in a day; and he frequently
rides to Winchester by himself, puts his horse up
at the inn, and, when he has done his business, goes off
home again. He is not yet ten years old. What a base
thing it would be to put such a boy to have outlandish
words flogged into him by an old dotard in a big white
wig! Why, if you were to put one of these * * * upon a
horse, he would fall off into the dirt! I will, if I live,
teach William to shave himself, and that will be much
more useful to him than Latin and Greek. I think of
sending Nancy for a year to the nuns at Winchester,
where they teach people to talk French and make
puddings.”</p>

<p>“… We have had a good meeting, and Mr. Finnerty<a name="FNanchor_4_34" id="FNanchor_4_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_34" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
will be with you with the account of it, some time early
to-morrow. I missed by a mere hair carrying a petition,
upon independent grounds, against both parties … the
Whigs, with their lords and baronets, had been a week
preparing their address; mine was done in Finnerty’s
room, while he was getting his breakfast; and in I went
to the hall without knowing any soul on my side but Mr.
Smith, Farmer Mears, about ten other yeomen who went
to dine with me, and Mr. Baker, who very boldly and well
seconded my motions.”</p>

<p>“… I have had letters from all parts of the country
beseeching me to persevere.…”</p>

</div>

<p>Concerning the forthcoming “State Trials:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I must confess that I am less pleased with this thing
than I should have been, if it had remained solely in
your hands. I very much question whether Mr. H.’s
taste is so good as your own; and I am quite sure that
we shall derive no comfort from any connexion with an
author.</p>

<p>“But it is too late to reflect; we will go on as well as
we can. Only mind to be always upon your guard
against letting him assume anything like a dictatorial
tone. Keep up your own consequence; for I know that
your modest merit is not very well calculated to resist
the encroachments of conceited importance.… Be sure
to tell him none of our political secrets. Suffer no
inquiries into our affairs. Let him see no copy of mine,
or my correspondents. Tell him of none of our intentions
about anything. I know how easy it is for any one
to worm himself into your unsuspecting breast; and,
therefore, I give these cautions. I think I perceive, in his
letters, a rather consequential air. But I am resolved to
have no partner, nor any one to give me advice, except
yourself. We have gone on so happily, and so advantageously,
by ourselves, that I am really in a state of alarm
at the prospect of admitting anything like an associate.
It must not be.…”</p>

</div>

<p>A vacancy in the representation of Hampshire
brings another county assemblage at Winchester;
on which occasion Mr. Cobbett requires each candidate
to take a pledge, that, if elected, he would
never accept the public money as long as he lived;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and would, moreover, use every endeavour to obtain
redress of the public grievances, especially that
trying one of having their money “voted away by
those, amongst whom there are many who receive
part of that money.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… The meeting at Winchester was very large, and
consisted of almost the whole of the people of considerable
property. Rose and his son were deterred from
appearing at the castle. The speech was infinitely better
than the <i>report</i>. I made use of no notes, except as far
as related to the sums. Not the smallest hesitation
from beginning to end; and, owing to the strength of
my voice and the clearness of my articulation, every word
I said was heard by the man the most distant from me.
The effect was very great. I spoke three-quarters of an
hour with very little interruption indeed, notwithstanding
I spoke to a party assembly, hostile to me, as far as party
could influence men. I wish you could have seen how
<i>little</i> the <i>great</i> looked after the speech had been made!
They went up to the castle swaggering, and in crowds;
they came sneaking back in ones and twos. Many of
them had the meanness to compliment me upon my
speech. I was invited to dinner by several; but I went
to my inn and dined with Mr. Baker, another neighbouring
clergyman, and Dr. Mitford, and then set off
home.</p>

<p>“No, be in no alarm about my hazarding my reputation
and happiness by standing as a candidate for this
county, or for any other place. That I never will be. If
any body of electors, anywhere, have a mind to choose
me, without giving me any trouble, I will serve; but at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
this time, I have not the least desire for that; on my
own account, I should wish not; but I am, in such a
case, not to consider myself only. I feel that I should
have power to serve with great effect; and I shall never,
I hope, be backward to make any useful sacrifice. But
I never will ask anybody to elect me.</p>

<p>“The boys have met me at Winchester sometimes;
and it is no bad school for them. While I was speaking,
I saw in the crowd several persons from Farnham, whom
I had never seen before, since I was their playmate. I
saw many to whom I used, when a boy, to make a very
low bow. Lord Temple came and shook hands, even
after the speech. And I must say that I think Mr.
Herbert<a name="FNanchor_5_35" id="FNanchor_5_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_35" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a very modest young man. In one part of my
speech, an attorney of the Rose party, who stood just
under the window, made an attempt to excite a clamour;
but I fixed my eye upon him, and, pointing my hand
downright, and making a sort of chastising motion, said,
‘Peace, babbling slave!’ which produced such terror
amongst others, that I met with no more interruption.…”</p>

</div>

<p>That Mr. Cobbett was unwilling to join in a cry
against a public character, without reason or
justice, was often manifest. His entire freedom
from party bias, as such, accounts for the frequent
distrust which he inspired, at the same time that it
helped to keep away from him the temptation to
hunt a man down merely because he was an opponent.
For example, he did not readily give ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to the charge made against the Duke of York on
the part of Major Hogan, although he was, at the
very time, raising the question of the Duke’s
exorbitant income. Mr. Cobbett could be just, and
loyal too. This story of Hogan’s might suit the
tribe of malignant, unreasoning scribblers; but he
has no idea of weakening his own writings by an
appeal to what looks uncommonly like an invention.
The <i>Register</i> holds out several warnings to the
Major; and Cobbett tells Mr. Wright more plainly
that he believes “Major Hogan has certainly told
a d&mdash;&mdash; lie, and ought to be exposed.… As
for Hague,<a name="FNanchor_6_36" id="FNanchor_6_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_36" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> he really seems to have courted a
jail.”</p>

<p>He presently adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They are fools, however, for touching him. But
thus they will go on to the end of the chapter. <i>Force</i>,
<i>force</i>, that is all their reliance. How much better to do
as I do&mdash;let slander work itself dead!</p>

<p>“… Bagshaw’s way is to be very quiet: when any
one mentions the matter to him, to say that he did as
others do, sold the book because it was called for. This
prosecution is the very foolishest thing that the Duke of
York ever was advised to do. Had he not begun this,
Hogan would have gone nearly to whitewash him.…
Poor Finnerty! what the devil did he suffer himself to
be so provoked for? I hope he will not incur a prosecution
for Hogan.…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“As to Howell, I always was afraid of him. I know
that he is what the French call ‘<i>un homme à grandes pretensions</i>;’
as, indeed, all your authors are.… They think
that every book that is printed is so much money coined.
They take the price, the full retail price, of a volume, say
a guinea-and-a-half, then they take the number of copies,
and hence they reckon that the bookseller has so many
guineas and halves in his drawer, the moment the book
is printed. You cannot beat this out of their brains.
They will have it so. Then they are full of their college
conceit, which is so intolerable.… With such people, a
partnership would be, for you and me, a most uncomfortable
thing. I greatly approve of the scheme of a ‘fag;’
and as to expense, four guineas a week would be cheap.
But he must work and be obedient.… I would sooner
give an additional guinea a week on the score of <i>obedience</i>,
than on the score of <i>talent</i>: though there must be considerable
talent too. If you can get rid of H., I shall
be very happy. I know what your college gentlemen
are. They always have, and will have, the insolence to
think themselves our betters; and our superior talents,
and industry, and power, and weight, only excite their
envy. I am heartily sorry we ever had anything to do
with H. All this may blow off; but I shall never have
confidence in him.…</p>

<p>“I will write to the major,<a name="FNanchor_7_37" id="FNanchor_7_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_37" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and to Holt White, upon the
subject of the Trials. Two better men there are not in
all England. The major is the very best writer that I
know, though he has scarcely a drop of blood in his
veins. Oh, that my mind, at his age, may be like his!</p>

<p>“Be sure to send off <i>Register</i> to Lord Cochrane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>, up to
this time. He is not come home. And no one can tell
when he will. Pray do not neglect this a day. I should
like him to see that I did justice to him in this country.
He, after all, is the best member for Westminster.</p>

<p>“Nancy will copy the manuscript of which you spoke
lately. She copied the whole of the Winchester proceedings,
with only three errors.”</p>

</div>

<p>The dissatisfaction with Mr. Howell would
appear to have arisen partly from an extreme
slackness in providing “copy;” and, with this, a
disposition to consider his own remuneration as of
the first importance. The difficulty, however, did
blow over.</p>

<p>The following refers to a letter of Major Cartwright’s
on the affairs of Spain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… Now, as to the major’s letter. Room I am
ready to spare him for four or five columns. But, if you
have the smallest doubt upon the libel subject, do not
put it in. Mark well every word relating to the Parliament.
Ferdinand, mind, must not be libelled; and <i>anything
is a libel</i>. If you can, by leaving out, or altering,
or adding, or qualifying, make it quite safe, put the letter
in; but not else.…”</p>

</div>

<p>This one appeared in the <i>Register</i>, but with
reference to a succeeding letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… Upon looking at the major’s last letter, page 944,
I am induced now to tell you not to put in his letter, if
there be the smallest thing doubtful in it. It may suit
him to accuse the judges, and the Attorney-General: <i>me</i>
it does not. I should be more afraid of that letter tha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>n
of anything I ever published in my life. They would
never touch a hair of <i>his</i> head. Therefore, mind!”</p>

</div>

<p>The fatal news of Corunna came, and routed up
the nation once more, in the course of January.
Two of Mrs. Cobbett’s brothers were with the forces
there, and no tidings had come from them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mrs. Cobbett and all of us join in best thanks to you
for your kindness and anxiety, in which you are never
wanting, and which, at this horrible hour, are so peculiarly
acceptable and grateful.… Poor Palmer! I can
easily conceive what he must feel, having myself held a
dying son in my arms. Mrs. Cobbett and Ellen, both of
whom love their brothers very dearly, are almost bursting
with grief and apprehension. Indeed, I feel most
sensibly myself. The whole nation will be in mourning.”</p>

</div>

<p>The two brothers, Tom and Frederick Reid, are
safe, however. Little Nancy writes thus to Mr.
Wright:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;My papa being very busy, he has
desired me to write to you and thank you for the trouble
you have respecting my uncles, and to tell you he
went yesterday afternoon in a great hurry to Portsmouth,
thinking they might be there, where he met with
Colonel Harding, commander of the artillery; who told
him that they were gone to Plymouth, and that they were
both well at Corunna when he came away, and that they
were not in the action, neither have they been much
engaged in active service, as some have. And, indeed,
mama and papa feel very much surprised and indignan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>t
at not having heard from them at all, knowing that they
have been at Corunna almost all the time, and having had
so many opportunities (which they must have had) of
writing either to papa or mama. Papa is so much vexed,
that he says now, if he had known they had been at
Corunna all this time, he would not have gone to Portsmouth
after them as he did. The colonel, he said, told
him, if they came there, he would send them over to
Botley directly. While papa was there, he found out
some officers of the 10th dragoons: he went directly, and
sent in his name by a waiter, and begged to know whether
Major Palmer was there, or whether he was safe. Upon
hearing their major’s name, two or three came to him and
told him he was safe at Plymouth, which was good hearing.
Mama will be very much obliged to you if you will
have the goodness to send her down a box of the biscuits
you have gotten several times; they are to be got at the
corner of Bond Street, in Piccadilly. She is quite ashamed
to trouble you; but a lady, one of the Miss Boxalls, is
coming here to stay some time next week, and she never
eats bread, always those biscuits; and there are none to
be got in Southampton. Mama and papa desire to be very
kindly remembered to you. Excuse haste. I remain, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Anne Cobbett</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The very interesting inquiry into the private
affairs of the Duke of York was perilous to editors
and pamphleteers. Mr. Wright sends word down
to Botley of his increasing fears lest his chief
should be compromised; and not without reason.
The exasperation of ministerialists was at its
height. Their writers brought forth wild imputations
against the opposition scribblers, and twisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and tortured their language and their meaning. In
vain, however; facts could not be gainsaid, and
upon facts alone they relied. The <i>Examiner</i>
which was then young, got into trouble over
Major Hogan; the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> was in
danger. But nothing could stop the ball which
Colonel Wardle had set rolling.</p>

<p>And, just as Mr. Cobbett had hesitated over
Major Hogan, he is still as cautious as ever concerning
Wardle; and wants to know, first, his
correspondent’s opinion as to Wardle’s capability
to bring forward proof of his charges, before
entering the lists himself. Yet, the game being
started, he laughs away fear; and, acknowledging
the kindness of Mr. Wright’s expressions of anxiety,
he says he “must stand the brunt. No flinching
would either be honourable or politic.” He will
defy prosecution, rather than give up the fight,
much as he “loves his fields and woods.”</p>

<p>One singular incident of this period is the case
of Miss Taylor; a lady who had, unfortunately for
herself, to give evidence of her acquaintanceship
with Mrs. Clarke. She, with her sister, had kept a
school, and the two were earning a respectable
livelihood. There was not the slightest ground for
tainting her character; but, having to admit, upon
a very unnecessary and malicious cross-examination,
that she was not born in wedlock, the fathers
and mothers of that moral, that highly-toned age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
could not brook the notion of their children being
educated by a &mdash;&mdash;, whatever name offended
society chose to give her. Her appearance in the
inquiry was the prelude to immediate ruin, for her
pupils suddenly vanished; and, as the affair got
into the papers, it was felt by some of the new
“patriots” that, to some extent, she was a martyr
to the cause. So they got up a subscription:<a name="FNanchor_8_38" id="FNanchor_8_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_38" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Mr.
Cobbett leading the way; and she was eventually
provided for. They should get husbands, he says
in one of his letters, “in spite of the <i>Morning Post</i>.”
But with his characteristic pertinacity, he will have
the money invested in no treacherous “Scrip.”
Lord Folkestone suggests India Bonds as a mode
of investment; but Cobbett’s answer is that not
one farthing of money, the disposal of which lies
with him, shall ever be laid out, for one hour, in any
India or Government security.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am fixed as a rock never to have any hand in doing
anything that shall tend to keep the Funds and the
Nabobs in countenance. It would be a pretty thing
indeed for me to appeal to the compassion of the public,
in order to raise the means of supporting these i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>nfernal
impostures. No, I will do no such thing, and besides, I
do not believe that the money would be secure.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“… From the article which appeared in the
<i>Courier</i> of Saturday, it is beyond a doubt that one of two
things must have taken place; either a copy of the
Register, or of proofs, must have been gotten out of Mr.
Hansard’s office; or my ‘copy’ must have been read and
copied at the post-office, previously to its going to you.
This latter would not at all surprise me; and, indeed, I
believe it to have been so. But I wish you to speak of
it to Hansard, and ask him for answer, positively, whether,
to his knowledge or belief, my copy did prematurely get
out of the printing-office. Because, this is a thing to state.
It is another striking instance of the desperateness of our
opponents.</p>

<p>“The news from the continent<a name="FNanchor_9_39" id="FNanchor_9_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_39" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> is not quite so good as
we thought it. That rogue, Boney, will certainly put an
extinguisher upon another venerable order of things, and
we shall (Lord have mercy upon us!) have another gang
of kings and princes to keep. It is odd enough that we
never get a queen here. We may have the Queen of
Naples anon, perhaps. ‘The Archduke Charles and
George Rose’ is, I hear, a toast at Southampton, which
really does make me hesitate before I decidedly pray for
the archduke’s further ‘success,’ and before I draw out
my handkerchief again to weep for the capture of Vienna.
If George Rose wishes success to the Austrians, it is, I
think, a pretty good proof that their success does not
tend to <i>our</i> good. The sheep must necessarily have
wishes in opposition to those of the wolf. I must confess
that this toasting of old Rose along with the archduke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
has tended to make me somewhat more reconciled
to the fate of the continent. What is good for the wolf
must be bad for the sheep; and <i>vice versa</i>, as the learned
say, what is good for George Rose must be bad for us.
No matter what it is: if it be good for George Rose,
it must be bad for us. Whatever makes the public-robbers
weep ought to make us laugh; and it does make
me laugh. Every blow that aims at their execrable power
is a blow to be applauded by us, and by the king too,
who is as badly treated as we are.</p>

<p>“I have a fine jackass, some pointers, and some beautiful
merino sheep, sent me from Spain; and they are
safely arrived. As I am very desirous of stinging the
robbers, I wish it to be said in some of the newspapers
that Mr. Cobbett has received a present ‘from Seville, of
a jackass of the real royal blood, two brace of Andalusian
pointers, and some merino sheep; the whole of which
are said to be the most perfect of their kind of any that
have ever been seen in this country.’ I should like very
much to have this inserted in a paper or two, merely to
enrage the rascals.</p>

<p>“The ass and the pointers I must send to London, for
they were carried round by mistake. The sheep I have
here, and most beautiful little things they are. I intend
to breed from them.”</p>

</div>

<p>The “rascals” were now at work over the Court-Martial.
As related in an early chapter of this history
(vol. i. p. 63), a garbled account of the affair was being
circulated broadcast over the country. Thousands
of copies were sent into Hampshire; and bales of
them were brought down by people from London,
in their carriages, and tossed out to the passer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>s-by.</p>

<p>For once in a while, then, Mr. Cobbett thinks it
proper to notice the current calumny. Although it
is obvious that the object of the attack is to discredit
him, and thus endeavour to destroy the effect of his
weekly writings, the story can be told in a different
way when it is discovered that part of it has been
suppressed; whilst the motive can, at the same
time, be exposed and expounded. Here are Mr.
Perceval and Lord Castlereagh conniving at the
sale of seats in Parliament,<a name="FNanchor_10_40" id="FNanchor_10_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_40" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and being exposed to
the world: is it any wonder that they should
retaliate? Is it any wonder that they also find
a story to tell?</p>

<p>But the <i>Weekly Political Register</i> having devoted
twenty columns to a version of the story,
which has truth and manliness in every sentence,
and which throws still more light upon the meanness
of its opponents: the thing drops out of sight
and hearing! If anybody does bring it up again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
it is only the exulting accused himself, who has
found one more opportunity, at their own hands,
of disconcerting his antagonists.</p>

<p>He is urged to pursue the matter; but he protests
his unwillingness to take up his time, and
that of his readers, with personal matters. He has
only done it now because it gives him an opportunity
of showing up the “incomparable baseness”
of Corruption; and the futility of her resistance to
the impending Reform: the blind and passionate
course which she is taking, in order to stifle inquiry.</p>

<p>One letter from Botley, referring to this matter,
is worth quoting:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… As to the twenty-two letters, I have full copies
of all the principal ones, and memorandum copies of all
the others. But, is it not evident, internally evident,
that letters were suppressed? Does the thing begin with
my charge? No, I cannot take your advice in keeping
the thing up. Those who like the fun of seeing me on
my defence, have either very little regard for my reputation,
or very little taste. It is useless to write any more
about it. What! do you really think I would condescend
to answer any one, who should call upon me to <i>produce</i>
letters, from which I make extracts, and which I say
I have before me? Why, don’t you see that even already
the <i>Post</i> calls my extract from my letter to Pitt a ‘fabrication’?
What nonsense is it, then, to talk of producing
the letters! Would not they be called fabrications
too? Oh, no! there may be just a sentence or two;
but there must be no more <i>defences</i>, take my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> word for that.…
I will, at any time, show Finnerty, Power, or any
friend, the original letters from the Secretary-at-War to
me, and mine to him; and also my letter to Pitt, and all
the charges. But I cannot condescend to do this to the
public; indeed, it is impossible. They must believe me,
or let it alone.”</p>

</div>

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As to the public-robbers, one <i>must lose</i> by a continuation
of the warfare with them. It is impossible to answer
fellows who, in their very signature, call ‘<i>Scoundrel</i>.’
Seriously to sit down to answer such fellows would be
to degrade oneself in an obvious manner. That will
never do. Besides, the thieves are beaten.…”</p>

</div>

<p>Lose: indeed! the day had come, at last. On
the very morrow of these swaggering lines being
penned, the <i>Political Register</i> had committed itself.</p>

<p>As, when the heated pursuer, sure of his game
as far as will, and equipment, are concerned, is
brought to the ground by some mean and unconsidered
obstacle: so this eager one, at the very
heels of his adversaries, finds himself suddenly
prostrate. And the now-exulting foe stands over
him; while cries of <i>Habet! Habet!</i> sound upon
his ears.</p>

against these two ministers, but the House negatived his motion
for inquiry. This case of “stifling” was one of the most bare-faced
of even that dark age, the debate going off on the dangers of Parliamentary
reform, and the “blessings we derive from the present
order of things.” One thing is certain, that not a soul in that
House doubted Madocks’s case. The “factious” minority numbered
eighty-five, of whom Sir Samuel Romilly was one. He
thought it impolitic of the ministry, on their own account, to try
and screen themselves, and justly concluded that the debate and
decision would powerfully act upon the cause of Reform. (<i>Vide</i> his
“Life,” ii. 116.)</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">“COMPARED WITH DEFEATING ME, DEFEATING
BUONAPARTE IS A MERE TRIFLE.”</span></h2>

<p>If there is one thing, more than another, characteristic
of the British soldier, it is his attachment
to home. Home, that is to say, in the hearts of
his countrymen, as well upon the hearth of his
parents. You cannot make a hireling of him; nor
is he a mere worshipper of glory. The links that
bind him to his comrades are the same with those,
which remain unsevered between him and the
civilian-class whence he sprang. This is obvious
enough, when we consider the general demeanour
of the people toward his profession. You may
see it, plainly, when the soldier is “in trouble;” or,
when two red-coats are quarrelling in the street;&mdash;but,
specially, on that supreme occasion when the
band is playing “<i>The girl I left behind me!</i>”</p>

<p>But there have been times where there was
danger of these affections being sundered. Notably,
during the later days of the Regency, when
army-legislation went far to make the soldiery a distinct
class, with interests hostile to those of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>“the mob.”
And, during the great war, the employment of
German mercenaries for purposes of home defence
(whilst the English forces were shedding their blood
on the soil whence those had been deported) was
naturally productive of some ill-feeling toward the
military profession.</p>

<p>Of the popular sentiment, concerning this topic,
there was never a better exponent than Mr. William
Cobbett, late of the 54th. His constant boast was,
that he had been a soldier, and knew soldiers “as
well as any man that ever breathed.” His appeals
on their behalf, whether addressed to the legislature
or to the people, breathe unfaltering affection
toward them. He would defend them, would
support them, would animate and would advise
them, as his brethren. And, while inculcating a
spirit of respect and affection toward them, on the
part of the people, he constantly objected to everything
likely to tend to the degradation of the
military character and calling. Did a company
pass through Botley, he would superintend the
billeting; and could not rest until men and officers
were suitably entertained. His army plan, published
in 1806, was entirely upon these lines: that
the military should be bound to their country by
the same ties with the rest of the nation. His
anecdotes of soldier-life would, alone, fill a large
volume; and, throughout his long life, there was
no source from which he could so readily draw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
pointed illustration of virtue, of energy, or of
loyalty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the year 1809, his Majesty’s ministers
had much to harass them; and not the least of
their anxieties was the conduct of the liberal part
of the newspaper press, concerning Flogging in
the Army and Navy. They were all condemning
the tortures of the lash: the abuse, itself, being
then as bad as it could be. Such was the outcry
against it, that it became evident that there would
have to be a struggle over the matter; and, in the
fight which did ensue, may be traced some of those
elements which eventually gave greater freedom to
the press of this country. It was known, at this
period, that newspaper-writers had been warned,
and that a severe example would be made of the
first offender.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Attorney-General, then, is on the watch; and
woe betide the wretch who defies Sir Vicary Gibbs!</p>

<p>And who is to be the victim? Shall it be James
Perry or Redhead Yorke? or those daring young
brothers, whose <i>Examiner</i> is slashing away at
everything and everybody they choose to disagree
with, and who have just had such a narrow escape
over Major Hogan? or one or other of those provincial
editors, who would cut off a little finger for
the sake of publicity and a wider circulation?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Perhaps one of these. But there is game that
must be brought down, if possible: the “must”
being so urgent, that the game shall be started
by our very best dogs. No inefficient pointing
here, if you please.</p>

<p>Accordingly, ministerial newspapers make ostentation
of flogging-cases. The interests of the
country demand: and so on. The exigencies of
the nation require: and so forth. The naval and
military forces are hot-beds of sedition, and nothing
was ever known to cure that, but the cat-o’-nine-tails.
And we shall lie at the mercy of the enemy,
if the entire nation is not sound on the subject
of mutiny: let us not, then, be mealy-mouthed in
the stern path of duty!</p>

<p>And the <i>Courier</i>, in its stern path, records (24th
June, 1809):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The mutiny amongst the local militia, which broke
out at Ely, was fortunately suppressed on Wednesday,
by the arrival of four squadrons of the German Legion
cavalry from Bury, under the command of General Auckland.
Five of the ringleaders were tried by a Court-Martial,
and sentenced to receive 500 lashes each, part
of which punishment they received on Wednesday, and a
part was remitted. A stoppage for their knapsacks was
the ground of complaint that excited this mutinous
spirit, which occasioned the men to surround their
officers, and demand what they deemed their arrears.”</p>

</div>

<p>No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>w, first, what is flogging&mdash;rather, what <i>was</i>
it?<a name="FNanchor_1_41" id="FNanchor_1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_41" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Let us have a few of Mr. Cobbett’s reminiscences
before we proceed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“At the flogging of a man, I have frequently seen
seven or eight men fall slap upon the ground, unable
to endure the sight, and to hear the cries, without
swooning away. We used to lift them back a little way,
take off their stocks, and unbutton their shirt collars,
and they came to after a little while. These were as
stout, hardy, and bold men as anywhere to be found.”</p>

<p>“I, who was eight years in the army, who was a sergeant-major
six years of the time, have seen men receive
their flogging at <i>twice</i>, at <i>thrice</i>, and I remember a man,
named Valentine Hickey, who received his flogging at
<i>four</i> instalments.”</p>

<p>“… In addition to the pain of the flogging, the
flogged man has to pay the drum-major for the use of the
cats!”</p>

<p>“The whip-cord may be large or small. Ours used to
be as thick as the very thickest twine made use of to tie
up stout and heavy parcels. The knots were about the
size, as nearly as I can recollect, of a dwarf marrow-fat
pea; and the length of the lash was, I think, about fifteen
or sixteen inches.… The drummers used to do the
flogging; they were always stripped for the work, and
each, by turns, laid on his twenty-five lashes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> and then
another came.”</p>

</div>

<p>Just so.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Saturday, the 1st of July, the <i>Weekly Political
Register</i> takes for its motto the above paragraph
from the <i>Courier</i>, and begins with the following
comments:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Local Militia and German Legion.</span>&mdash;See the
motto, English reader! See the motto, and then do
pray recollect all that has been said about the way in
which Buonaparte raises his soldiers. Well done, Lord
Castlereagh! This is just what it was thought your
plan would produce. Well said, Mr. Huskisson! It
really was not without reason that you dwelt, with so
much earnestness, upon the great utility of the foreign
troops, whom Mr. Wardle appeared to think of no utility
at all. Poor gentleman! he little imagined how a great
genius might find useful employment for such troops.
He little imagined that they might be made the means
of compelling Englishmen to submit to that sort of
<i>discipline</i>, which is so conducive to the producing in
them a disposition to defend the country at the risk
of their lives. Let Mr. Wardle look at my motto, and
then say whether the German soldiers are of <i>no use</i>. <i>Five
hundred lashes each!</i> Aye, that is right! Flog them!
flog them! flog them! They deserve it, and a great deal
more. They deserve a flogging at every meal-time.
‘Lash them daily! lash them duly!’ What! shall the
rascals dare to <i>mutiny</i>? and that, too, when the German
Legion is so near at hand? Lash them! lash them!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
lash them! They deserve it. Oh, yes! they merit a
double-tailed cat! Base dogs! What! mutiny for the
<i>price of a knapsack</i>? Lash them! flog them! Base
rascals! Mutiny for the price of a goat’s-skin; and then,
upon the appearance of the German soldiers, they take a
flogging as quietly as so many trunks of trees! I do not
know what sort of a place Ely is; but I really should
like to know how the inhabitants looked one another in
the face while this scene was exhibiting in their town. I
should like to have been able to see their faces, and to
hear their observations to each other, at the time. This
occurrence at home will, one would hope, teach <i>the loyal</i>
a little caution in speaking of the means which Napoleon
employs (or rather, which they say he employs) in order
to get together and to discipline his conscripts. There
is scarcely any one of these loyal persons who has not,
at various times, cited the hand-cuffings, and other means
of force, said to be used in drawing out the young men
of France; there is scarcely one of the loyal who has
not cited these means as a proof, a complete proof, that
the people of France <i>hate Napoleon and his Government</i>,
assist <i>with reluctance in his wars</i>, and would fain <i>see another
revolution</i>. I hope, I say, that the loyal will, hereafter,
be more cautious in drawing such conclusions,
now that they see that our ‘gallant defenders’ not only
require physical restraint, in certain cases, but even a
little blood drawn from their backs, and that, too,
with the aid and assistance of <i>German</i> troops. Yes; I
hope the loyal will be a little more upon their guard in
drawing conclusions against Napoleon’s popularity. At
any rate, every time they do, in future, burst out in
execrations against the French for suffering themselves to
be ‘chained together and forced, at the point of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
bayonet, to do military duty,’ I shall just republish the
passage, which I have taken for a motto to the present
sheet. I have <i>heard</i> of some other pretty little things of
the sort; but I rather choose to take my instance (and
a very complete one it is) from a public print, notoriously
under the sway of the ministry.”</p>

</div>

<p>So much for your “comment-maker.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What personage had the distinction of walking
home from church with Mr. Perceval, on the following
day, history does not record: his comments,
then, remain in oblivion. No matter that, however.
In about three weeks after the above
publication, Mr. Cobbett has news from London,
which he thus retails:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… I have a most serious business to impart to
you, and that is, that I hear from Mr. White, that the
miscreants are about to prosecute me for the article about
the flogging of the local militia. What I wish you to do
is to go to Mr. White and ask him,</p>

<p>“1. Whether the thing be <i>certain</i>?</p>

<p>“2. What is to be done in it by me, in the first
instance?</p>

<p>“3. At what time it will be required for me to be in
town to give bail?</p>

<p>“4. When the trial will take place?</p>

<p>“5. Of what nature is the bail that I must give?</p>

<p>“It is quite useless to fret and stew about this. I
must meet it. They may probably confine me for two
years; but that does not kill a man; and may, besides,
produce even good effects, in more ways than one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“But the main thing is to be prepared. There is a
<i>possibility</i> of acquittal, though they push their malice to
its full extent. Let us, therefore, be prepared; let us
take all proper precautions; and then wait the chapter
of accidents. Your better way will be to show this part
of my letter to Mr. White, and pray thank him most
heartily, in my name, for his kindness in giving me the
information.… What I would do, in case of imprisonment,
is this. I would make F. Reid come and
take charge of my lands, &amp;c. I will, even <i>now</i>, cut
off all expenses of horses, dogs, &amp;c., so as to make up
for the loss; and I would have such a plan of economy
as should enable me to have my family near me, if possible.
Thus, you see, my mind is made up to the thing.
I care for nothing that they can do. I would certainly
defend myself.…</p>

<p>“… Let me alone; if they will but leave me the
use of the press, I’ll beat them all, I warrant you.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Reeves appears to have been sounded, by
Mr. Wright, upon the possibility of escape from
prosecution. Cobbett expresses some displeasure,
however, on hearing of this, and adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… I am fully prepared for the worst, and therefore
am no longer under any anxiety. I would rather be gibbeted,
than owe my life to the intercession such as you
speak of, and such as I am afraid you half-solicited.
I told you to keep very quiet. Say nothing at all about
the matter to any one. Ask no questions; and only be
sure to tell me precisely what you hear. I am not afraid
of them. Times are coming on when we shall all have
enough to do; but, in the meanwhile, I shall not worry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
myself to death with apprehension.…”</p>

</div>

<p>Instead of any fear of the future, the look-out is
rather toward the welfare and increase of his
estate. Some plots of land have just been purchased,
with the object of making freeholders of
Wright, Finnerty, and others. The prospects of
harvest are very bad, for the rains have been
so incessant, that wheat is growing in the ear; but
the trees are coming on “delightfully.” Lord
Cochrane arrives home, and comes to see Botley
with the tale of his grievances.</p>

<p>Mr. Cobbett pays his occasional visit to Lord
Folkestone, at Coleshill; and horses and puppies,
and hares and pheasants, reappear in their order,
not at all as though the threatened danger would
be anything beyond a scare.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among Mr. Cobbett’s friends was one who had
become peculiarly bound up in his affairs, through
circumstances which must now be noticed.</p>

<p>Mr. John Swann, of Wolvercot and Ensham, in
Oxfordshire, was an eminent paper-maker of that
day; his mills being the chief sources of supply
for the University of Oxford. He had supplied
also the paper for the <i>Register</i> from a very early
period; and it would appear that a strong attachment
existed between him and the Cobbetts. As
far back as September, 1805, when purchases of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
land were being made in Hampshire, somewhat
beyond Mr. Cobbett’s command of ready money,
Mr. Swann had assisted him by discounting accommodation
bills. At the death of the latter, in
January, 1807, his brother James succeeded both
to the paper-mills and to the accommodation
paper; and to the friendship thus continued into
another family, we are indebted to some further
glimpses of Cobbett’s happy domestic life. Mr.
Swann is initiated into the mysteries of planting:
eels from the sluggish Oxford streams grace the
table at Botley, and game from Hampshire that of
Ensham. And, as time fled on, the perilous accumulation
of “credit” seemed only to add new
links of love.</p>

<p>The following selection from correspondence
belongs to the later months of 1808:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">James Swann</span> to <span class="smcap">John Wright</span>.</p>

<p>“I am not at all surprised at the increased sale of the
<i>Register</i>; every one who reads it is astonished at the wonderful
extent of Mr. Cobbett’s abilities. God grant him
a long life, for the country’s sake!… Mr. Barwis has
lately been with Mr. and Mrs. Cobbett at Botley; they have
kindly promised to be sponsors to a son Mrs. Swann presented
me with a fortnight ago, whom I shall have named
William.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wm. C.</span> to J. S.</p>

<p>“Mr. Barwis has communicated to me your wish
respecting my being godfather to your son, and I assure
you, with perfect sincerity, that I shall look upon it as
doing me honour. I never was yet a godfather to any
child but one of my own, who was born in a heathen
country; and there are very few persons, to a child of
whom I would stand godfather; but one of yours I shall
with great pleasure. I hear it is to be after Christmas,
which will suit me best, as I have a great deal to do here
before, in the planting way, which I cannot possibly trust
in any hands but my own.…</p>

<p>“I have now a favour, in the sporting way, to ask of
you. I have had most lamentable luck with dogs, having
lost almost the whole of a fine and rare collection of
spaniel and greyhound puppies. Of the latter I shall not
take much pains to get any more, the places for coursing
being at such a great distance from me; but of the former
I want many, because we live amongst such covers as
nothing can be moved out of without a plenty of good
spaniels. The sort we want is the short-legged, rather
coarse-haired, long-eared, and feathered down the legs to
the very tips of the nails. This is the most strong, true,
and resolute race. None other will do in endless covers
like ours, where the stuff is so very thick, and there are
such quantities of matted thorns as sharp as pins. Now,
if you should happen to know of a famous breed&mdash;some
gentleman whose breed is famous all over the country&mdash;I
should like to have a brace; which may, perhaps, be
obtained by speaking time enough beforehand. But
there is another condition (for, when one is begging, one
may as well go the whole length), I wish not to have them
till they are at least four months old. Young puppies, if
of a high breed, will not live.…</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is, I am told, a fine breed called the Woodstock
or Blenheim breed; but, if you will inquire, you
will easily find out a fine breed. <i>Every one’s dogs are the
best in England</i>; but there are some gentlemen and noblemen
(a very few) of standing reputation for their breed of
spaniels, and a brace of this sort it is that I want. Spaniels
should have no spice of <i>the hound</i> in them. Tan colour
over the eyes is, therefore, a sure mark of reprobation.
Such will hunt hares; and, when they have moved one
in a large thick cover, the sportsman may go a-shooting
by himself.</p>

<p>“After all, if the thing be attended with much trouble,
pray do not take it, for your time is too valuable to be
wasted in the gratification of my whims.”</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">J. S. to J. W.</p>

<p>“I duly received yours this morning. I was much
amused with the caricature, it is certainly a good one. I
heard from Mr. Cobbett a few days ago, and am endeavouring
to procure him some good spaniels. I do not
expect our christening will be till about or after Christmas,
when I shall be glad to see you here. I have
another son to go through the ceremony besides William,
whom we shall name <i>John</i>, and shall beg you to be his
godfather.…”</p>

</div>

<p>This excursion did not come off till May, 1809,
for some reason or other. Mr. Wright was very
nearly being entrapped into matrimony on the
occasion, with an interesting widow who was one
of the visitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wm. C.</span> to J. S.</p>

<p>“We got home in very good time; but had the mortification
to see the road drier and drier, as we advanced,
till, when we came to Botley, the dust flew, and we have
not had one drop of rain since. Nevertheless, all my
plantations go on exceedingly well. I am satisfied that,
with some people’s planting, half the trees would now
have been dead. Get the books I recommended, and in
the <i>Profitable Planter</i> see the articles ‘Willow’ and
‘Black Italian Poplar.’ The aspen is good, and I prefer
it. But be sure not to plant Lombardy poplar. It is
not fit even to burn.”</p>

</div>

<p>An important outward change came over the
<i>Register</i> at the beginning of the year 1809. Mr.
Cobbett had for some time been dissatisfied with
the printing of Messrs. Cox and Baylis; and it was
therefore transferred to Mr. T. C. Hansard. An
improvement was manifest at once, and the <i>Register</i>
took the position of those publications which
were discarding the antiquated types of the past.
Some little notion of the extent of the enterprise
that was going on may be gathered by an estimate
furnished to Swann of the probable <i>monthly</i> supply
of paper that would be required:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Paper">
  <tr>
    <td>“Register</td><td class="tdr">60</td><td>reams.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>State Trials</td><td class="tdr">96</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;“</td>

    <td class="bordered">Total</td><td class="tdr bordered">256</td><td class="bordered">reams.”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> the <i>Register</i> was in 16 pages 8vo, with occasional
supplements, the weekly circulation must
have been nearly six thousand at this period.
Very soon after this change, the price was raised
to 1<i>s.</i> from 10<i>d.</i>, at which figure it had stood since
its commencement. The price of paper had risen
from 24<i>s.</i> to 43<i>s.</i> a ream, and the newspaper stamp
from a halfpenny to 3½<i>d.</i>; besides that, other expenses
had proportionally augmented. Great must
have been the hold which Cobbett had obtained,
over a large number of readers, for his journal to
have been able to keep its place under such circumstances.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The threatened prosecution hung so long over
Mr. Cobbett’s head, that some of his friends began
to hope that nothing would come of it. He probably
thought, for his own part, that the Government
were not unmindful of the sort of antagonist
he would make, when driven to bay; and that
they would think twice before going into the contest
without the minutest preparation, and the best
possible opportunity. In a letter to Mr. Swann,
dated 28th November, he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You have, I suppose, heard of the dead set which
the Attorney-General is making upon us. My opinion
is that it will come to nothing at all. But, if it does, we
must beat them, if there be either spirit or honesty left in
England.”</p>

</div>

<p>Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>ere will be no lack of preparation, however:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wm. C.</span> to <span class="smcap">J. Wright</span>.</p>

<p>“Dear Sir,&mdash;As I am to have the pleasure of seeing
you on Wednesday, I shall say the less here. But, as to
the now most interesting subject, I cannot help saying a
few words, as they may be usefully communicated to Mr.
Bagshaw and Mr. Hansard, <i>in confidence</i>. My resolution
is to plead my own cause, if I am well in health. Nothing
upon earth, illness excepted, shall make me forego this
resolution. I am also resolved to defend; that is, to
<i>justify</i>; and to render the affair a great public question.
The sooner we begin, the sooner we shall be well prepared,
and the more likely to secure a favourable issue.
You will know how and where to get me the authorities,
or facts, for showing,&mdash;</p>

<p>“1. That the ministers, or their partisans, have been
employed for more than six months in publishing libels
against me; atrocious falsehoods (such as the 4000<i>l.</i>
story) for the purpose of exciting, in the public mind, an
evil opinion of me; and thus pave the way for this state
prosecution.</p>

<p>“2. That the ministers themselves (or, at least, Canning,
&amp;c.) have written libels, if these be libels; and, upon this
point, to get together all the <i>accusations</i>, and all the <i>nicknames</i>,
used by the Anti-Jacobins against Moira, Nichol,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>“3. That there were <i>caricatures</i> prepared under the
eye of Canning, &amp;c., and of whom, and how they were to
be represented as traitors.</p>

<p>“4. That there are writers hired, or paid, by the Government.</p>

<p>“5. To get a good historical view of the state prosecutions
for libel, and show how they have originated with
bad Governments and wicked lawyers; and to show, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
short, that the Stuarts suffered more from this cause than
from any other.</p>

<p>“6. To get collected, all the best speeches and strong
sayings of eminent men against an army of foreigners in
England. You will easily get me some good matter upon
this subject, by looking back into the <i>Parliamentary History</i>.</p>

<p>“7. Think of any of the poets who have written against
mercenary foreign armies.</p>

<p>“8. Have not the Swiss and Walloon Guards, in Spain,
now joined Buonaparte?</p>

<p>“9. I must have, from good authority, the particulars
of the contract made with the German Legion, about not
being sent out of Europe.</p>

<p>“It will be time enough to set about any part of this,
after you have been here; but you will turn your mind to
the several points in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>“Be particular in attending, now, to any publication
whatever, wherein mention is made of this prosecution,
and especially if it has for its object the prejudicing of
the public against me. When I get hold of such a thing,
I shall begin my operations.</p>

<p>“Do as you please about mentioning my intention to
defend myself, to Hansard, or any of them; but be sure
to tell them from me, that I hold the thing in contempt;
that I am no more afraid of the rascals than I could be
of so many mice. And, really, if we have an <i>honest jury</i>,
it will be a famous thing altogether.</p>

<p>“I thank you very kindly for your news about my wife.
I am a great deal more anxious about her than about the
prosecution.”</p>

</div>

<p>He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> continues to remind his correspondent that
it will answer no purpose to soothe his anxiety by
flattering him with hopes of escape. At the end
of the year, there is, however, still no prospect of
the trial coming on. The following is dated 31st
December:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What I want information about, relative to the
approaching trial, is, in the first place, a reference to all
the debates which you know anything of, against foreign
troops.… You said that Mr. Bosville had a list of
instances of those countries who had fallen under a
defence by foreign troops. Can you get it from him?
It would do for a mere enumeration in a speech. Arguments
against a mercenary army apply equally well to
foreign troops. I shall think of other matter in my next.
I will prepare everything here against the 23rd, and, as
soon as we find that the cause <i>is</i> to come on, I will set off
for London, and continue there till the cause be over.
In the meanwhile, I will arrange a defence in my own
way. If we have an honest, I mean an <i>impartial</i> jury,
I am no more afraid of Vicary than I am of a fly.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the 8th January, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… I have read the trial of Tooke all through, and
also his other trial, in the case of Fox’s action against
him.… What villains he had to deal with! His life
is a history of the hypocritical tyrannies of this jubilee<a name="FNanchor_2_42" id="FNanchor_2_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_42" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
reign. I shall profit a good deal from this reading; but
mine must be a defence of a different sort; less of law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
knowledge, and more of a plain story, and an appeal to
the <i>good sense</i> and <i>justice</i> of my hearers.</p>

<p>“I do not know that I mentioned the following things
to you before:&mdash;</p>

<p>“1. That number of the <i>Courier</i> which contained the
article that I took for a motto to the flogging article.</p>

<p>“2. Those numbers of the <i>Post</i> and <i>Courier</i> which, as
you told me, contained an exhortation to prosecute me.</p>

<p>“Indeed, we should have files of those papers for the
last eight months; for I must dwell upon the endeavours
to excite prejudice against me.”</p>

</div>

<p>The same letter proceeds to mention his plans
for arranging his pecuniary affairs&mdash;a matter of
hardly-inferior importance, considering their tangled
condition. As soon as possible, he will then go up
to London to await events.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… I do not know whether they have given a
notice of trial, formally; but I think they will.… They
feel the deep wounds I have given them; and they lose
sight of everything but revenge. I really do not know
which I ought to wish for&mdash;a trial or a <i>nolle prosequi</i>. My
character and fame call for the former; but then, my
health and my dearly-beloved family call for the latter, or
for anything which shall preclude the chance of a villainous
sentence. However, I am rather indifferent about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
matter.…</p>

<p>“… God send us good luck; but if not, good <i>heart</i>,
which I trust I, at least, shall not want. My intention is
to meet my accusers in a manner worthy of the advocate
of truth.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. James Perry was in trouble again, early in
1810. The Attorney-General had filed information
against the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> and the <i>Examiner</i>, for
a paragraph in which the Whig hopes of the day
were embodied. These hopes were to be fulfilled
when the Prince of Wales succeeded to the throne,
and the obnoxious paragraph ended with these
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Of all monarchs, indeed, since the Revolution, the
successor of George the Third will have the finest opportunity
of becoming nobly popular.”</p>

</div>

<p>The interpretation put upon this by the “friends
of order”<a name="FNanchor_3_43" id="FNanchor_3_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_43" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was, that the life of George III. stood
between his people and the blessings in store for
them! Mr. Perry conducted his own defence, and
was acquitted; and the record as against the
<i>Examiner</i> was forthwith withdrawn. This <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>occurrence
was a subject of rejoicing to the whole tribe
of scribblers,&mdash;at least, of those who were not
subsidized; and the failure of the prosecution
correspondingly inflamed the minds of the administration.
Peter Finnerty was another victim
of this year. And, after some further halting, it
was determined to bring forward the record against
Mr. Cobbett, after his friends had begun to be
tranquilized with the hope that he would not be
molested.</p>

<p>It is highly probable, but for the urging to prosecution,
on the part of the ministerial press, that he
might have been let alone. But they would not
be true to the common cause. Bound in the fetters
of party, or of pence, the press was, as yet, ignorant
of the latent force which has since made of it a
Fourth Estate. And, with respect to Mr. Cobbett,
it is impossible to withhold the conviction that the
envy and the injustice of his rivals had more to
do with moulding his fortunes than all other causes
put together.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wm. C.</span> to J. W.</p>

<p>“Your letter, this day got, contained the best and most
agreeable news.… We have all, I and my wife, six
children, and every soul in the house, drunk Mr. Perry’s
health. I made even little Susan lisp out the words.
Pray give my kindest and most respectful compliments to
him; and tell him that I do not only most heartily r<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>ejoice
at his success (which, by the bye, does not surprise me),
but beg leave to present my sincere thanks; in which, I
trust, I only participate with the rest of the gentlemen
connected with the press. Nothing but the necessity of
attending to my concerns here this week would have prevented
me from returning to town immediately, in order
to endeavour to urge in person, what I request you to urge
for me; namely, a public dinner at the Crown and Anchor,
of ‘the Friends of the Liberty of the Press,’ at which
we ought to pass a vote of thanks to Mr. Perry, and to
proclaim some principles that may be of the utmost importance
in future. Now is the time for us to assert our
rights, and the respectability of our profession and
character.<a name="FNanchor_4_44" id="FNanchor_4_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_44" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>… Mr. Perry has done more good than any
man of his time, and it is for us to profit by it.…”</p>

</div>

<p>An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>other public incident, of this period, was the
celebrated conflict of Sir Francis Burdett with
“Mr. Speaker.” Mr. Gale Jones had been imprisoned
by the House of Commons; and Burdett
took occasion to address his constituents,&mdash;by
means of a long letter in Cobbett’s <i>Register</i>&mdash;denying
the power of the House to imprison any but
its own members. The letter was composed by
Cobbett himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker walked home from church<a name="FNanchor_5_45" id="FNanchor_5_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_45" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> with Mr.
Perceval on the following day. The latter proposed
to move the House to commit Burdett to
the Tower, and order the attendance of Cobbett.
And so, as every one knows, the metropolis was
upset, for the space of two or three months, by an
indecent squabble, which brought the House into
great disrespect, and made Burdett the idol of the
populace. In the end, it required 50,000 soldie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>rs
and militia to get him into the Tower; but not all
the king’s horses, nor all the king’s men, could
rend away the mantle of ridicule which the action
of ministers had brought upon themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Cobbett was not ordered to attend the bar
of the House. More the pity: Cobbett in Newgate,
illegally imprisoned by order of the House of
Commons, would have been a very different affair
to Cobbett in Newgate <i>ex</i> The Attorney-General!
Yet he was not forgotten.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wm. C.</span> to J. W.</p>

<p>“So, then, the honourable House have, at last, resolved
to have the <i>Register</i> read to them. That is one sign of
amendment, and if they do but follow it up by a similar
motion every week, it cannot fail to do them a great deal
of good, if anything in this world can do them good. If
they call me before them, I shall say that, as the Speaker
himself sent me his speech to publish, I, of course, thought
it right to publish the speech of any member of the House,
especially when he put his name to it.</p>

<p>“But what I am, at this moment, anxious about, is that
Mr. Madocks should again bring forward his last year’s
motion. You will perceive that the worry now making
is about breaches of privilege, tending to degrade and
vilify the House. Now, what can have so clear and strong
a tendency this way, as the having <i>sold seats in the House</i>,
and the having turned out a member for not being willing
to vote against his conscience? Why not punish those
who were guilty of such offences? This is the ground
whereon to proceed; and what a fine, what a striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>,
what a glorious effect it would have now, to renew Mr.
Madocks’s motion! What could they do? What could
they <i>say</i>? Good God! what an exhibition they would
make before the country!…”</p>

<p>“… So far so good! I am delighted with what
has taken place, and especially with the conduct of Lord
Folkestone,<a name="FNanchor_6_46" id="FNanchor_6_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_46" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who, as I always told you, is the truest man
in all England. Don’t you remember the eulogium that
we pronounced upon him, at your house, on Friday?
That is the good of him: you may always depend upon
him for more than he promises you. Who would have
thought, some years ago, that he would have been the
man to answer the minister? And to beat him, too!
His speech, even as reported, is a master-piece; and there
was no time for preparation. I always told him what he
was able to do, if he could but muster up courage.…”</p>

<p>“… The decision upon the Walcheren affair is
what was to be desired, I think, looking to the only
object which we ought to have in view, a Reform of the
Parliament. Now, then, what will the Edinburgh
Reviewers say? I shall now quote their own words
against themselves. Will they now openly join us, as
they said they would, or will they again shuffle? At any
rate, the honourable House, so far from agreeing with the
country, have approved of what the country has most
unequivocally condemned. This cannot fail to tell. Will
the Whigs <i>now</i> join the people? They have no other
rational course left, but will they not rather sink into
eternal oblivion?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>In the middle of May, the Attorney-General had
made up his mind; and Mr. Cobbett came up to
London to the “naming” of the jury.</p>

<p>Upon his return to Botley, his hands are fuller
than ever. Money has to be provided, so that
there shall be no tradesmen in Hampshire left
unpaid. “Since last January we have paid for
everything, the butcher excepted, as we have had
it. No bills of any sort; and I must leave here
none at all, if I can help it, when I go up to the
trial.”</p>

<p>Copy for the <i>Register</i> goes up to London in
undiminished quantity; and there is, besides, the
preparation for his defence. Friends furnish hints,
and supply him with books:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To-day has been devoted wholly (since seven o’clock)
to the reading of the volumes sent me by the coach.
That sent by Mr. Holt White is full of most excellent
matter. In short, if those who are to decide are not
<i>baseness itself</i>, I am safe.”</p>

</div>

<p>Those who were to decide were, at length,
brought together, and they took two minutes over
it.</p>

entering the fiftieth year of his reign, there had been great “rejoicings.”
The Parliamentary Reformists, however, did not approve
of it, holding that <i>the prosperity of the country</i> was a hypocritical and
delusive cry. Mr. Cobbett boasted of his refusal to subscribe
toward giving the twelve hundred thousand paupers “that rarity,
that luxury, a bellyful,” and gave very good reasons for it. The
Whig papers, too, heaped much derision upon the affair. One of
the incidents of the day was a fellow sticking up a placard at
Charing Cross, in these terms: “May God disperse the votaries of
Cobbett, as the clouds of this day!”</p>

the fish-market; e.g., “To the indignation and execration of the
British nation do we therefore consign this damning specimen of the
abominable and infamous sentiments by which the base faction are
impelled in their most unprincipled and diabolical pursuits,” was
the remark of the <i>Post</i>, at the close of its comments upon the wicked
<i>Chronicle</i>.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_44" id="Footnote_4_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_44"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The “profession and character” of the fraternity had just been
roughly assailed in Parliament by Mr. Windham. The question of
excluding reporters from the gallery of the House of Commons was
one which would come up at intervals, and it was one upon which
most public men changed their opinions, from time to time, according
to circumstances. Mr. Windham was now for shutting the
gallery; and he described the publishers of the Debates as bankrupts,
lottery-office keepers, footmen, and decayed tradesmen, and
he had heard “that they were a sort of men who would give into
corrupt misrepresentations of opposite sides.” As Mr. Wright was
the only person among the parliamentary reporters who could be
put under the head of “bankrupts,” the <i>Political Register</i> gave
Mr. Windham a castigation.
</p>
<p>
The venal writers of the day, of course, called this black treachery
and ingratitude. But then such writers had no interest in upholding
the craft&mdash;rather the other way. Of this class was the <i>Satirist, or
Monthly Meteor</i>, one of the foulest pieces of rubbish that ever
disgraced the periodical press. This paper recommended that
Cobbett’s article (which was in extremely temperate terms) should
be framed and glazed by every public man, as a warning never to
trust this wretch, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Satirist</i> was one long-drawn libel. The editor must have
been utterly insusceptible of shame, or else must have been in the
habit of deadening his moral feelings by artificial means. Even the
good and patriotic Whitbread was represented as one who delighted
in practising, upon his own estate, that tyranny against which he
declaimed in the House of Commons. As for Finnerty, he is always
“the miscreant,” and Mr. Wardle, “the l&mdash;&mdash;r.” Wright is described
as “the poor devil who now corrects Cobbett’s bad English,
edits his Parliamentary History, brushes his coat, puffs him in coffee-houses
and debating-shops, and does all his other dirty work,” &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
It is very difficult to please everybody. The <i>Examiner</i> presently
began to write down Mr. Windham, supporting itself with this
affair of the reporters, and howled at Mr. Cobbett for not doing the
same. The fact being that Cobbett was especially careful to avoid
needless animadversions upon his old friend.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">“THE FOLLY, COMMON TO ALL TYRANTS, IS THAT
THEY PUSH THINGS TOO FAR.”</span></h2>

<p>On the 15th June, 1810, the Court of King’s Bench
was at last prepared to hear the Attorney-General’s
story. Mr. Cobbett, Mr. Budd, Mr. Bagshaw, and
Mr. Hansard accordingly appeared, to answer the
charge of writing, printing, and publishing a seditious
“libel.” Stern Ellenborough presided within,
and a deeply-interested public waited without, the
Court.</p>

<p>Withal,&mdash;Mr. Attorney-General, Lord Ellenborough,
and the expectant public, each and every
one knew, in his heart, that Mr. Cobbett was about
to be tried for exposing the king’s ministers; for
his sarcasms over the Duke of Clarence and
“Mother Jordan;” for showing up Mrs. Clarke;
for his discoveries in political corruption; aye, and
for quarrelling with the <i>Morning Post</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Attorney-General’s story, however, dealt with
none of these topics. The burden of his tale was,
that the defendant charged the Government with
cruelty, and suggested to the wicked mutineers th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>e
cruelty and injustice of their punishment. That
certain brave and honourable men had been driven
from their own land, and had “sought shelter in
ours;” and had offered their blood for the glory
and safety of their adopted country. That the
defendant’s paper was a libel on the brave and
honourable men; while its obvious tendency was to
deter the common people from entering the militia.</p>

<p>The speech of the defendant was temperate, even
to tameness. The opportunity of accumulating
fire and passion, in support of unwelcome truth,
was thrown away. But there is little doubt that
Cobbett had some faith left in the honesty of a
jury; besides a fallacious belief that the ostensible
cause of the prosecution was the real one, and that
the matter would be decided upon its merits. Had
he, rather, boldly scorned the adversary, and dared
him to disprove that the present was an episode in
political warfare, which gave undue advantage (for
the time) to the cause of might against right: at
the same time, reiterating his wish to excite the
public indignation against amateur tyranny, had
kept up an attitude of defiance,&mdash;the foe would
have been cowed, although, perhaps, not made
more relenting. There was no mercy in Vicary
Gibbs, nor in Lord Ellenborough, toward the champions
of the press; and Mr. Cobbett, as champion
for the day, should have recollected that the cause
itself was again on its trial. The day wou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>ld be
certain to go against him; it was notoriously a
personal attack; but, had he chosen to disregard
his own personality, and to hurl back in the
Attorney’s face the persecuting character which
that worthy had given to his office,&mdash;he would have
dealt that stroke at licensed hypocrisy which was
left for the task of William Hone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One grave error was committed by Mr. Cobbett
in his defence: it was very weak for him to say
that the words were written <i>in haste</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_47" id="FNanchor_1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_47" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Otherwise,
the general burden of his speech was: how atrociously
he had been calumniated, from his first
appearance as an independent writer, to the present
moment, with the Attorney’s unjust imputations on
his loyalty and honesty; and how the Government
was known to be influencing the propagation of
such calumny. That he had done good to his
neighbours and to his country, according to his
measure. That the Attorney’s forced constr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>uction
of his words could not be borne out. That his
attachment to the British soldier could not be questioned.
That the so-called Hanoverian legion was
composed, to a great extent, of persons of no
country; and that they were a nuisance, from their
general bad behaviour, in whatever part of England
they happened to be quartered.<a name="FNanchor_2_48" id="FNanchor_2_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_48" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>This last was, of course, a fresh libel, of which
the Attorney-General did not fail to make a new
point. And he had the meanness to try and prove
that the delay in the prosecution was the defendant’s
own doing.<a name="FNanchor_3_49" id="FNanchor_3_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_49" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He thought, too, that the
defendant had better consulted his character and
fame, by going along with the three other culprits,
in suffering judgment to go by default.</p>

<p>Lord Ellenborough went through the libel <i>seriatim</i>,
making his own comments; and concluded,
after asking the jury whether its tendency was not
to injure the military service,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is for you to say whether these be words escaped
in haste from a man, otherwise writing temperately, but
whose zeal overshot his discretion; or whether they are
the words of a man who wished to dissolve the union of
the military, upon which, at all times, but now especially
at this time, the safety of the kingdom depends. If this
latter be the case, surely the defendant will meritedly fall
under the character of that seditious person, which the
information charges him with being. In cases like the
present, the law requires me to state my opinion to the
jury; and, where I have held a different opinion to that
which I have of the present case, I have not withheld it
from the jury. I do pronounce this to be a most infamous
and seditious libel.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was now midnight, and the jury had nothing
in the shape of a doubt in their minds. Why
should they have? They had no doubts when they
took their seats in the morning. Juries were juries
in those days; why should they have doubts, at
the end of a drama, for the particular conclusion of
which they were particularly brought together?</p>

<p>So they “consulted” for about two minutes, and
returned their verdict of “<i>Guilty</i>.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">J. Swann</span> to <span class="smcap">J. Wright</span>.</p>

<p>“I learned the unfortunate result of the trial about two
o’clock on Friday, and immediately hastened to the hotel,
Covent Garden, to see if Mr. Cobbett would require any
bail, but I found he had left town. I need not tell you
how much I am concerned at the verdict.…”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wm. C.</span> to J. W.</p>

<p>“I found Mrs. Cobbett very well, and quite prepared
for what had happened. She bears the thing with her
usual fortitude; and takes hourly occasion to assure me
that she thinks I have done what I ought to do. In this
she is excellent. She is the only wife that I ever saw,
who, in such circumstances, did not express <i>sorrow</i>, at
least, for what the husband had done; and, in such cases,
sorrow is only another word for <i>blame</i>. Nancy was a
good deal affected, but she soon got over it. If I had
but about three weeks for preparation I should like it
better; but I must settle things here as well as I can.
Dr. Mitford will tell you <i>what has been suggested to me</i>, and
what (if anything) will be done in consequence of it.</p>

<p>“Send me by the coach to-morrow … Mother
Clarke’s book, for I must notice the contents of it this
week. You will have, in my writing, twenty-four columns,
the greater part of it by to-morrow’s and next day’s posts.
The rest of the double-number I should like to have
made up of proceedings about reform, such as have
appeared in the <i>Times</i> and other daily papers; but, at
present, the more harmless the things are the better.
I shall write as boldly as ever, but I will take care of my
subjects. The proofs of approaching scarcity can be no
longer disguised. It will be very great and complete indeed.
I shall be disappointed if the quartern loaf be not
half-a-crown before Christmas. I wonder whether it be
true that Buonaparte has stopped the exportation of corn
from his dominions? If it be, you will soon see the
effect of it. You see, that no rascal of a newspaper has
touched upon the subject. It will come upon us by-and-bye
with a vengeance.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span><i>What had been suggested?</i></p>

<p>The reader will recollect [<i>ante</i>, p. 96] that the
notion of any intercession on his behalf was warmly
deprecated by Mr. Cobbett from the very first; and
no sign of a craven spirit had appeared during all
these twelve tantalizing months. His mind was
made up. The long-deferred prospect of a term in
prison had been getting still more remote, and its
accompanying terrors would be unheeded. But,
back again among his beloved fields and woods,
and surrounded by a little family which could but
dimly appreciate the situation; struck with anxious
cares that must result from his predicament, he
listens to a <i>suggestion</i>.</p>

<p>The form and the terms of that suggestion are
unknown, and will probably remain unknown; that
is of little consequence, however. Suffice it to say,
that before a week was out, negotiations were going
on, through Mr. John Reeves, for some measure
of indulgence, by which, at least, the Attorney-General
was to hold his hand, and not move the
Court for judgment. At the same time, a farewell
article was prepared for the <i>Political Register</i>; for
Mr. Cobbett foresaw that he could not continue it
without softening his tone, if he were to be indulged;
and softening his tone was out of the
question. Preparations were made for disposing of
the remaining sets of the work, and for renouncing
his profession of political writer, “until better days.”</p>

<p>This weakness did not last long. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
would seem to have been a suspicion that the
Government were enticing him into making the
sacrifice before letting the law come down in all its
force.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wm. C.</span> to J. W.</p>

<p>“I will not sacrifice fortune without securing freedom
in return. It would be both baseness and folly. Your
threat to R[eeves] was good, and spoke my sentiment
exactly. I have not time for telling you my plan now;
but let it suffice that, really, from the bottom of my
soul, I would <span class="smcapuc">RATHER</span> be called up than put down the
<i>Register</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the following day, Peter Finnerty posted up
to London with full powers to stop negotiation,
and to see that the farewell article was cancelled.
Need it be said that the affair got wind? It was
intended to get it in the wind. No one can doubt
that this was a final effort to add to the discomfiture,
and tarnish the reputation, of a really brave
man, by exposing him to the charge of having sold
himself at last.</p>

<p>And the effort was, to some extent, successful.
Absurd versions of the story were circulated for
years afterwards, and ridiculous misrepresentations
are still afloat: all of which have the merit of being
consistent, on one point, viz., in the exhibition of
an unquenchable hatred toward one of the bravest
and faithfulest souls that ever breathed.</p>

<p>After Finnerty’s departure, the spirits o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>f the little
household arose once more. “Indignation and resentment
took place of grief and alarm;” Mrs.
Cobbett and her little Nancy got their courage
back again; and the master wrote up to London&mdash;“The
best way is to be as calm as possible, and to
wait with patience for better days.” Even Mr.
Wright, inspired with returning pluck, thinks there
ought to be “something powerful” sent up for next
week’s paper.</p>

<p>On the 5th of July, the four defendants answered
to their bail, while the Attorney-General prayed
the judgment of the Court. Fresh hypocrisy was
uttered, of course:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The army, against whom this libel is in a peculiar
manner directed, calls on the Court for judgment against
its traducer.… The Government calls for confirmation
of its legal powers.… The country calls for
protection against the numerous evils which the propagation
of such publications was calculated to engender.…
Justice is called for; and justice, to be sure,
will be tempered with mercy. But the Court will not
forget that mercy is due to the public, as well as to the
defendant at the bar.”</p>

</div>

<p>The defendants were forthwith committed to the
King’s Bench prison, with directions that they be
brought up on the following Monday to receive
sentence.</p>

<p>The <i>Register</i>, meanwhile, had been for two
consecutive weeks without any contribution to the
topics of the day, on the part of the editor; an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>d
now, again, he is compelled to apologize, for the
third time, for a similar omission.<a name="FNanchor_4_50" id="FNanchor_4_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_50" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He had not
nearly completed his domestic arrangements, before
it was necessary to leave Botley for the last time.
And, as for sitting down to write for the information
or the amusement of the public, every one must feel
the impossibility of his being able so to divert his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
mind from the circumstances in which he was now
placed. He could not banish the thought, that
exactly ten years ago to the very day, he landed
in England, “after having lost a fortune in America
solely for the sake of that same England;” yet his
reflections, he added, were “in some measure
driven out by the contempt which I feel for the
venal slaves who have seized upon this (as they
regard it) moment of my depression, to misrepresent
and insult me.”</p>

<p>Westminster Hall was crowded on the following
Monday. Strangers were ordered to be removed
from the lower part of the Court; but the order
had to be disregarded, for fear of adding to the
confusion. Ellenborough, with three other judges,
occupied the bench, of whom Mr. Justice Grose was
the one selected to pass sentence. After judgment
had been prayed, in the usual form, the judge
proceeded to remark upon the enormity of the
offence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The libel was a work which no well-disposed mind
could doubt to have been framed for the most pernicious
objects. Looking at the time at which it was written&mdash;looking
at the circumstances of the world&mdash;there could be
no doubt of the evil intentions of the paper. The whole
tendency of it was, in so many words, to excite unwillingness
and dislike to the service of the country, amongst
those who are to be its defence, and to insult those
foreigners who are in our service, to deprive the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>country
of their honourable assistance, and to paralyze the energies
of the State. The objects of the libel were too palpable
for doubt, &amp;c.… “The jury found you, William
Cobbett, guilty, upon the fullest and most satisfactory
evidence. If it were to be allowed, that your object was
not to enfeeble and embarrass the operations of Government,
there can be no ground for exculpating you from
the guilt of libelling, for the base and degrading object of
making a stipend by your crime. If there had been no
other imputation upon you, the Court, as protecting the
purity and peace of the public mind, would have felt itself
called on to punish you severely. It is strange that a
man who mixes so much in general and private life, as
you do, should not see that such acts, as those for which
you have been tried, are only productive of mischief to
every mind that is influenced by them; and that they
necessarily terminate in punishment on the guilty authors.
It is strange that experience should not have taught
you, and that you should be only advancing in a continual
progress of malignity. What were the circumstances
which you distorted in your libel? the whole
intention of which was to throw disgrace on the Government,
and to disgust and alienate the army. If you had
anything to offer in extenuation, you might have offered
it; the Court would have received it; and, at all events,
impartial justice would have been dealt to you. I now
pass the sentence of the Court upon you, William Cobbett,
as the principal criminal amongst those who now stand
before the Court: the Court do accordingly adjudge that
you, William Cobbett, pay to our Lord the King a fine of
1000<i>l.</i>; that you be imprisoned in His Majesty’s gaol of
Newgate for the space of two years, and that at the expiration
of that time, you enter into a recognizance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
keep the peace for seven years&mdash;yourself in the sum of
3000<i>l.</i>, and two good and sufficient sureties in the sum of
1000<i>l.</i> each; and further, that you be imprisoned till that
recognizance be entered into, and that fine paid.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Hansard was then sentenced to three
months’ imprisonment in the King’s Bench, and to
enter into recognizances for three years. Mr.
Budd and Mr. Bagshaw were each sent to the same
prison for a period of two months.</p>

<p>A smile<a name="FNanchor_5_51" id="FNanchor_5_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_51" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> arose on Cobbett’s face as the terms
of this dread sentence were unfolded,&mdash;a sentence
which must needs either crush its victim into
irrevocable ruin, or so press down upon an unknown
and unsuspected buoyancy, as to bring
upon its authors a recoil from the effects of which
they would never escape.</p>

<p>From that hour, the sword which had been so
near laying by to rust, had its blade new tempered,
whilst the scabbard was clean cast away for ever.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_47" id="Footnote_1_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_47"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Augustus de Morgan gives a story which he had from Francis
Place. Place was, with others, advising Cobbett as to the proper line
of defence. “Said Place, ‘You must put in the letters you have
received from Ministers, Members of the Commons, from the
Speaker downwards, about your <i>Register</i>, and their wish to have
subjects noted. You must then ask the jury whether a person so
addressed must be considered as a common sower of sedition, &amp;c.
You will be acquitted; nay, if your intention should get about, very
likely they will manage to stop proceedings.’ Cobbett was too
much disturbed to listen; he walked about the room, ejaculating,
‘D&mdash;&mdash; the prison!’ and the like. He had not the sense to follow
the advice, and was convicted.” <i>Vide</i> “Budget of Paradoxes,” p. 119.</p>

Cobbett, says upon this point, “The truth was on Cobbett’s side,

of issuing <i>ex officio</i> informations was to lay an information against
the offending writers, but not to proceed to trial, exacting a promise
from them that, if he did not pursue it, they would write nothing
offensive to the Government, and thus holding it <i>in terrorem</i> over
their heads.”&mdash;Andrews’s “British Journalism,” ii. 57.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_50" id="Footnote_4_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_50"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This omitting to write for two or three weeks, together with the
rumoured dropping of the <i>Register</i>, created tremendous sensation
among the scribbling fraternity. The <i>Morning Chronicle</i> returned
to Cobbett all the warm feelings which Perry had received from
him. The <i>Examiner</i>, on the other hand, was mercilessly unjust.
That vigorous paper was then in its early priggish days, and could
brook no rivalry. Leigh Hunt looked with contempt upon all the
set of Cobbetts and Cochranes, as not Reformists after his sort, and
he now proceeded to attack Cobbett violently for his timidity, and
for his whining about being torn from his home, &amp;c.; adding that
politicians must be prepared to endanger individual freedom for the
sake of the general good. But then the “spirit of martyrdom had
been inculcated” in the Hunts from the very cradle.
</p>
<p>
The readers of the <i>Examiner</i>, however, were not at one with
their editor upon this point. One correspondent thought it ill-befitting
a Reformist to overlook all the merits of a fellow-labourer,
just at the moment of his being down, and “to dwell with a
malignant ecstasy on all the failings that industrious malice could
scrape together from years of bold and zealous service.” It was
also pointed out, with much justice, that Mr. Cobbett was singular
in this: that he not only confessed his errors when he had found
them out, but argued clearly and decisively against them. Of
course, the <i>Examiner</i> was so clever that it had no errors to retract.
</p>
<p>
Leigh Hunt appears to have discovered, in after-years, that he
often made extravagant demands upon other people’s virtue; and
the allusion, in his autobiography, to some want of charity toward
other people’s opinions, points to this period, when intolerance could
animate the Radical quite as easily as the privileged mind.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Redhead Yorke had long been converted from Radicalism,
and had no sympathy for the delinquent. But he was, now, on the
other side.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="smaller">“TO PUT A MAN IN PRISON FOR A YEAR OR
TWO DOES NOT KILL HIM.”</span></h2>

<p>So the patriot was down. Down, among the
felons. To keep company, for a period of two
years, “with swindlers, and with persons convicted
of the most detestable crimes,” was he set down;
unless he should ransom himself away from their
immediate society. There he was, torn away from
home, subjected to untold difficulties, financial and
other, and deprived of liberty&mdash;in the cause of
humanity and of national justice.</p>

<p>The absurdity of this outrageous sentence was
soon manifest. The whole country cried “Shame!”
Even the toad-eating ministerial newspapers were
silent. Save mutilation, it was going back two
hundred years.</p>

<p>Not that this was a solitary affair: there were
other sufferers in durance vile, or with the prospect
of it over their heads; and the existing generation
had not forgotten the victims of 1792-4. But this
was so notorious: here was a man whose writings
were patriotic, manly, eloquent;&mdash;and so far unsu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>rpassed
by those of any of his cotemporaries&mdash;bundled
into jail for speaking the plain truth about
public affairs, and proving it as he went along.</p>

<p>Exactly a year ago it had been openly declared
that they were determined to crush him! And
now the blow had fallen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They thought that this savage sentence would break
my heart, or at least silence me for ever. It was, indeed,
a bloody stab. They thought they had got rid of me.
Just after the verdict of <i>guilty</i> was found, Perceval met
his brother-in-law Redesdale, at the portal of Westminster
Hall. They shook hands, and gave each other joy!…
Curtis<a name="FNanchor_1_52" id="FNanchor_1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_52" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> met Tierney in the Hall: ‘Ah! ah! we
have got him at last,’ said Curtis. ‘Poor Cobbett! let
him be bold now!’ The old place-hunter answered,
‘D&mdash;n him! I hope they’ll squeeze him!’ They did
squeeze indeed; but their claws, hard as they were, did
not squeeze hard enough.… The ruffians put me into
prison in lucky time for me&mdash;put me into prison, and
tied me to the stake of politics.”</p>

</div>

<p>But let that pass. A prison is a prison. A
convicted libeller is a convicted libeller. And, a
convicted libeller having made his bed, let him lie
upon it! The wretch should have taken into the
account, when he made his stab at a merciful but
just executive, that he ran the risk of being <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>thrown
into the enforced companionship of other villains.
He had made his choice: it was not for him to
complain that the logic of events had left him in
jail, and that folks outside were laughing at him.
Yes, let that pass, it is no concern of ours. That
which it behoves us to consider&mdash;that which is
infinitely more interesting to us&mdash;is this question,
<i>What came of it all</i>?</p>

<p>In the first place, before Mr. Cobbett was released,
flogging had become so discredited as to be
nearly in desuetude, as regards the British army.
Secondly, the degrading practice was totally
abolished in the United States army, by Act of
Congress of April 10th, 1812.</p>

<p>As was observed in a previous chapter, this topic
was now uppermost in the public mind. And, as
though sufficient warning had not been derived
from the fate of Cobbett, a reckless provincial
editor must needs court a similar martyrdom.
This was Mr. Drakard, of the <i>Stamford News</i>,
who admitted into his paper, of the 24th August,
a bitter paragraph concerning “<span class="smcapuc">ONE THOUSAND
LASHES</span>;” a paragraph “of a nature so infamous,
so seditious, and so dangerous, that no good man
who heard it read could restrain his resentment,”
&amp;c. Of course. So, as Mr. Drakard had made
his bed, he might lie upon it; which he did, for
the space of eighteen months in Lincoln jail,<a name="FNanchor_2_53" id="FNanchor_2_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_53" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;for
the sake of dear good men, who could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
“restrain their resentment” at being told, that
punishment and merciless barbarity were not convertible
terms.</p>

<p>Those were, indeed, good old times. If there
is anything, more than another, which stamps
mediocrity upon the governing men of that day
(not excepting the “first gent.” himself), it is their
persistent disregard of the affections of the people,
as displayed in the measures entertained by the
Legislature;<a name="FNanchor_3_54" id="FNanchor_3_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_54" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the callosity of heart and mind
with which they faced any appeal to the better
feelings of human nature, on behalf of the unnumbered
and unwashed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At last, however, flogging was being deprecated.
And it is due to Sir Francis Burdett, to record, that
he was instrumental in bringing the attention of
Parliament to the matter. He had moved, in
1808, without effect, that a return of floggings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> be
presented to the House. Again, in 1811, he revived
the subject, with the result that a clause
found its way into the Mutiny Bill, having for its
tendency the “lessening the quantity of flogging
in the army.” In the following Session, Burdett
insisted upon the necessity of abolishing the
practice altogether: vainly, however; although
his action produced an unmistakable change in
the tone of Government and its supporters.</p>

<p>During this discussion, in March, 1812, Mr.
Brougham brought Cobbett’s name into the proceedings,
to the infinite disgust of some ministerial
toad-eaters. They protested: they “felt extremely
hurt that the indiscreet language of the learned
gentleman should go out to the public, as bidding
the army look up to Mr. Cobbett for redress,
instead of to their own officers.”</p>

<p>They had done better to leave Mr. Cobbett to
his own native insignificance; and not rouse him,
with his whip-cord in hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Here is, even from the mouths of the Government
themselves, an acknowledgment that it is a good thing to
make the practice of flogging less general. This they
have now distinctly avowed, that it is desirable to narrow
this practice; and they boast of having, in some degree,
succeeded by the means of a clause in the last year’s
Mutiny Act. Now then, said Mr. Brougham, if this
be the case, or as far as the good has gone, it is to be
attributed to the press; and that, while those w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>ho were
honest and bold enough to begin this battle in the cause
of humanity; while those who fought the good fight and
won an inestimable victory in that great cause; while Mr.
Drakard and I were shut up in a prison, the Government
were boasting of the success of a measure founded upon
our principles. He added, that ‘the legislature had been
obliged, with respect to this question, to act upon the
very principles of Mr. Cobbett, who was now in jail for
his unseasonable declaration of them.’ This seems to
have given great offence to several members of the honourable
House, who observed that the soldiers ought to be
taught to <span class="smcapuc">THANK THEIR OFFICERS</span> for the measure, and
<span class="smcap">not Mr. Cobbett</span>! Oh, dear, no! That would be a
sad thing! It would be a sad thing if the soldiers were
to look to <span class="smcapuc">ME</span> for redress; especially after my being sent
to a felon’s jail, which, of course, was to mark me out for
a man to be shunned, rather than looked up to. The
truth is, that this merit of having been the beginner of the
battle in the cause of the soldiers does not belong to me.
It belongs to Sir Francis Burdett.…</p>

<p>“Sir George Warrender describes Mr. Brougham as
bidding the army look to me for redress instead of looking
to their own officers. Why, really, I do not see why
this should hurt the gentleman’s feelings so much. What
harm could it do? What could the public or the soldiers
learn from any speech of Mr. Brougham more about me
than they know already? They all know very well what
I am in jail for.… The newspapers were kept full of
me and my <i>crime</i> for the best part of a month; from the
newspapers I and my crime got into the caricature shops;
and, in short, while in jail myself, all those (and very
numerous they were), who were in hopes that I was gone
to my last home, used every means in their power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
blacken my character.…</p>

<p>“Surely Sir George Warrender might have trusted, in
such a case, to the <i>understanding</i> of the army! He might
surely have confided in their <i>taste</i> not to look up to me
instead of their officers, especially after the repeated
assurances of Sir Vicary Gibbs, that the army <i>despised</i>
such writings as mine, and held their authors in abhorrence.
After this, I think Sir George Warrender might
have spared any expression of the wound given to his
feelings at hearing language that tended to induce the
army to <i>look up to me</i> instead of looking up to their own
officers for redress. ‘<i>Indiscreet language!</i>’ As if the subject
had been all <i>tinder</i>: as if there had been imminent
danger in even warning me, lest the soldiers should hear,
or see, my name! Really, though sitting here in a jail,
I can hardly help laughing at the idea.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“When it was known in America, that so heavy, so
dreadful a sentence, had been passed upon me, a sentence
which no man could regard as much short of death;
a sentence surpassing in severity those for nineteen-twentieths
of the <i>felonies</i>; when this sentence was heard of in
America, where every creature was well acquainted with
what I had there suffered from my devotion to my country,
every one naturally felt eager to know <i>what I could
have done</i> to merit such a sentence? And, when the people
of that country came to see what it was; when they
came to read the article, for the writing of which I was
to be so heavily punished; when they came to consider
the subject-matter of that publication, and to reflect on
how they themselves might become interested in it,
there naturally came forth through the press an expression
of some sentiments which have finally had their ef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>fect
in producing the Act of Congress above inserted; and
thus has the hateful practice of flogging men been abolished
by law in a great and rising, and wonderfully-increasing
nation. I do not pretend to say that the
American Government would have had any desire to
continue the practice of flogging, though the discussions
on the subject had never taken place in England. On
the contrary, I am of opinion that that Government was
glad of an opportunity of getting rid of it; but I am of
opinion that the thing would not have been thought of,
had it not been for the discussions in England. Sir Vicary
Gibbs was little apprehensive of these effects when he was
prosecuting me; he could scarcely have hoped that his
labours would be productive of consequences so important,
so beneficial, and honourable to mankind; he hardly, I
dare say, flattered himself that he was ensuring the extension
of his renown through a whole continent of readers.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was, then, no idle boast, that imprisonment
need not kill, nor even seriously injure, a man:
that a jail was “as good a place for study as any
other.” But, really, although the temporary loss
of liberty is an unpleasant thing, considered in the
abstract, there can be no possible objection to a
man putting as good a face as he can on the
matter. Life itself is nothing but a life-long
struggle of a kindred character: to try and get an
optimist view of bad circumstances. And, if one
must needs take his daily exercise upon the leads
of Newgate prison, instead of through his coppices
and cornfields: if he must get his “violets and
primroses, and cowslips and harebells,” sent up by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the carrier, because of their extreme rarity in the
street below; let him thank a propitious Heaven
for so much!</p>

<p>In point of fact, few prisoners were ever so
blessed as Cobbett. The reader is familiar enough
(from the pages of “Advice,” &amp;c.) with the current
of domestic joy that kept flowing. But, besides
having one or other of his family continually with
him, there were always sympathizing visitors: personal
friends, business acquaintances, deputations
from clubs and societies all over the kingdom.
And, what was of no little importance, Matthew
Wood was sheriff, who attended, in every possible
way, to the comfort of his prisoner. Baron Maseres<a name="FNanchor_4_55" id="FNanchor_4_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_55" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
came frequently, and “always in his wig and
gown, in order, as he said, to show his abhorrence
of the sentence.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was hardly arrived when the brave old Major Cartwright
came.… You [<span class="smcap">Peter Walker</span>, of Worth,
Sussex] were the next to arrive; and when, by dint of
money, I had obtained the favour to be put into a room
by myself, you hurried home, and brought me bedstead,
chairs, tables, bedding, and everything; and I think I
see you now, stripped in your shirt, putting the bedstead
together and making up my bed. During the whole of
the two years you never suffered me to be lonely; and
your kindness was such, that when you found me engaged&mdash;when
any one arrived&mdash;you instantly departed, unless
pressed to stay. Thus proving that your visits arose
solely from your desire to alleviate the sufferings of confinement.
And, at the close of the period, though the
sum was so enormous, and the period so long, you, with
my excellent friend <span class="smcap">Brown</span>, voluntarily became my bail,
and spoke of it, as he did, as an honour done to
yourself.”</p>

</div>

<p>And, as to his health, Cobbett would boast in
after years that he never had even a headache for
a moment; never enjoyed better health or spirits;
never had hopes more lively, or thoughts more
gay, than in that prison.</p>

<p>But that which, above all other matters, appeared
to be the great solace of his prison-life, was the production
of his famous work on the Currency, under
the title of “Paper against Gold.”<a name="FNanchor_5_56" id="FNanchor_5_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_56" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The tricks
and contrivances by which paper-money had been,
along with the funding system, made the means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
placing unwieldy fortunes in the hands of speculators,
was his utter abhorrence. The glory was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
departed from England, in his eyes, if public credit
were to hang upon the prosperity of the few, as
against the multitude. And, regarding a fictitious
currency, shifting in value from day to day, sometimes
even from hour to hour, as a leading cause
of the debt which was accumulating to such a
terrible figure,&mdash;he resolved to devote a part of
his newly-found leisure to the systematizing of his
thought upon the subject.</p>

<p>Accordingly, upon the 1st of September, he
commenced a series of papers, founded upon the
recent report of the Bullion Committee; tracing
the history of the National Debt, and of the
schemes for raising money which had been in
vogue during the war.</p>

<p>Here is his story (told in 1822) of the first conception
of the plan, and his notion of its value:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The next day after Gibbs, Ellenborough, and their
associates, had got me safe in Newgate, an American
friend of mine, who had the clearest and soundest head
of almost any man I ever knew in my life, and for whom
I had and still have a very great personal regard, came
to see me in a very miserable hole, though better than
that to which I had been sentenced, and from which I
finally ransomed myself at the expense, for <i>lodging</i> alone,
of 1200<i>l.</i> Being seated, one of us on each side of a little
bit of a table, he said, looking up into my face, with his arms
folded upon the edge of the table, ‘Well! they have <i>got
you</i> at last. And now, what will you do?’ After a moment
or two I answered, ‘What do you think I ought to do?’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
He then gave me his opinion, and entered pretty much
into a sort of plan of proceedings. I heard him out, and
then I spoke to him in much about these words: ‘No,
Dickins, that will never do. This nation is drunk, it is
mad as a March hare, and mad it will be till this beastly
frolic (<i>the war</i>) is over. The only mode of proceeding,
to get satisfaction, requires great patience. The nation
must suffer at last, and greatly and dreadfully suffer, and
in that suffering it will come to its reason, and to that
justice of sentiment, which are now wholly banished. I
shall make no immediate impression by tracing the paper-system
to its deadly root. The common people will
stare at me, and the rich ruffians will swear; but the
time must come when all will listen; and my plan is to
write that <i>now</i> which I can hold up to the teeth of my
insolent enemies, and taunt them with in the hour of their
distress.…’ I then described to him the outline of
what I intended to do with regard to the paper-system;
and after passing a very pleasant afternoon, during which
we selected and rejected several titles, we at last fixed
upon that of <i>Paper against Gold</i>, which I began to write
and to publish in a few weeks afterwards, and which, at
the end of thirteen years, I hold up to the noses of the
insolent foes who then exulted over me, and tell them,
‘This is what you got by my having been sentenced to
Newgate: this was the produce of that deed by which it
was hoped and believed, that I was pressed down never
to be able to stir again.…’ This was a new epoch in
the progress of my mind. I now bent my whole force to
one object, regarding everything else as of no consequence
at all. The pursuits of agriculture and gardening filled
up the moments of mere leisure and relaxation. Other
topics than that of paper-money came now and then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
make a variety; but this was the main thing. I never had
any hope in anything else; and nothing else was an object
of my care.”</p>

</div>

<p>So the attempt to crush him was a failure.
Rather, they read defiance in every page; and, as
time wore on, it was seen that the silence of defeat
was on the side of Mr. Cobbett’s foes. The Press
ignored him; that Press which had, from envy at
his superior talents and his unexampled success,
ransacked the vocabulary of Billingsgate in order
to abuse a man they could not answer; which had
so goaded and inflamed the persecuting spirit of
the time, that none dared speak or write who were
not sheltered by privilege, or who had not bartered
independence for the favour of those in power.
Not for several years after this date was there
much desire shown, on the part of a ministerial
writer, to attract the glance of this rampant lion.</p>

<p>And they might well be quiet. If this imprisonment
had neither killed nor cured him, Mr. Cobbett
came out of Newgate an altered man. He was
now fifty years of age, and a few grey hairs were
just appearing. The enormous expenses which he
had been put to (amounting, from first to last, to
more than six thousand pounds), and the discovery
that his business affairs were hopelessly involved,
made up a bundle of difficulties which began to
tell upon his temper. Good-natured sarcasms made
place for bitter ones; and an air of spitefulne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>ss
would come over his writings when there was more
than ordinary cause for resentment. His essays
were, albeit brilliant as ever, sometimes marred by
the introduction of coarse epithets; and, during
the remainder of his career, this cause alone sufficed
to estrange many of his friends, and to put a stone
into the hand of opponents.</p>

<p>Mr. Cobbett’s writing must be considered as at
its very best during the years 1810-12. He probably
gave some time to revision; a point which
he had been inclined to neglect, and a matter
concerning which he seemed utterly heedless in
later years; the exclusive devotion to his pen, now
so far removed from rural distractions, necessarily
produced better work.</p>

<p>But it cannot be said that there was any deterioration
in Cobbett’s literary style, beyond the
warmth of expression engendered by fiercer
animosity. The best known works of William
Cobbett belong to the last twenty years of his life;
and if they are painfully full of personal hatreds, it
must be recollected that those were, indeed, times
to try men’s souls; the oppressor and the oppressed
had seldom been, in England, in such close conflict;
and a leader and guider of men, on the side of the
latter, had need to be fierce and uncompromising.
The soldier, foremost of your storming-party, has
little time to spare for consideration of the personal
merits of the foe, whose gunstock is swinging o’e<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>r
his head.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The more serious result, personally, of the
sentence pronounced upon Mr. Cobbett, was the
utter collapse of his pecuniary fortunes. The
enormous profit derived from the publication of
the <i>Register</i> might have been sufficient to cover
even the profuse expenditure of Botley House,
with its hospitality and its planting experiments,
but Mr. Cobbett was eminently a person who (as
the Hebrew poet has it) earned money to put it
into a bag with holes.</p>

<p>This matter, however, might be passed over with
light notice, but for its interference with Cobbett’s
public services. His is not a solitary instance of a
useful life being marred, and its efficiency hindered,
by an ignorance of the value of money; and there
could hardly be a more decisive evidence of the
disastrous results of such ignorance than is presented
by this man’s career. <span class="smcap">Plutus</span> is the most
exacting of deities; his votaries must be whole-hearted;
let <span class="smcap">Fortuna</span> come and cast off her shoes
as she may.…</p>

<p>It was never Cobbett’s aim to get rich. He had,
indeed, hoped to provide a snug competence for
his children; but for plans of amassing wealth he
had supreme contempt. To earn by labour, and to
circulate the proceeds, was his economy; and it
cannot be denied that, with proper prudence, th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>at
is the right economy. The greatest enemy to
national prosperity is the plutocrat; and the next
greatest is he who can afford, in the prime of life,
to live without labour, through the mistaken
munificence or benevolence of another.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It would appear, then, that upon accounts being
looked into, in the autumn of 1810, money affairs
were found to be almost hopelessly entangled. The
three great serial works,&mdash;the “Debates,” “Parliamentary
History,” and “State Trials,” were being
produced at a ruinous loss; while the accommodation-paper,
chiefly in the hands of Mr. Swann,
amounted to thousands of pounds. Cobbett had
not looked at his balance for six years! His
practice was to ask Mr. Wright to send him ten,
twenty, or forty pounds as he wanted it; and to
leave the rest of the matter implicitly to him.
Wright was, himself, not very clever in the management
of money; and, between the two, there came
at last the profoundest muddle. It ended in an
arbitration, held in the prison; the result being a
heavy award against Wright, and a total and irremediable
rupture of their friendship. Mr. Budd
bought up a large portion of the publications in
stock; while Mr. Hansard took into his own hands
the three serials which he had been printing for
Cobbett.</p>

<p>The quar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>rel with Mr. Wright is the most painful
episode in Cobbett’s life. There can be no doubt
that Wright had been a reckless agent, and had
been trusted far too much; and his conduct, some
years after, in producing an old, long-forgotten,
private letter of Cobbett’s, to serve electioneering
purposes, was so infamous a breach of confidence,
that it may well be believed that his employer’s
imputation of dishonesty had foundation in actual
fact. Of this matter we shall unhappily hear more
in the sequel.<a name="FNanchor_6_57" id="FNanchor_6_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_57" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The following letter to Mr. Swann
(dated Newgate, January 26, 1811) may be selected
as best illustrating the existing condition of
affairs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I find, from Mr. Bagshaw, that one of the notes,
given by him to you, or at least accepted by him, at our
settlement and renewal of bills, under the auspices of
Wright, is coming due on Tuesday (I believe it is), and
we have no money to pay it. You remember that he
told me that all these notes were given for books bought
by Budd and Bagshaw. As it happens, the former was
nearly true; but, as to the latter, not a shilling was due on
that account. The whole was a fraud upon me, in order to
make me believe that the works had sold to this extent; and
his view was to get an assignment of the stock, and leave
me to pay myself as I could. I have now an abundance
of <i>bonâ fide</i> notes, but no money; every sixpence being
swallowed by the notes left unpaid and unrenewed at the
time you were here. A series of such unprincipled conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
I never either knew or heard of; but I am aware
that my having been a dupe is no justification for me
with you. Within these five weeks I have not had an
hour’s peace; but I have obtained forbearance from those
whom I could not pay, and have avoided, except with you,
putting my name to any new bill. My wife knows all
about the matter; and plenty of vexation it has given her.
I imagine I can pay this first note in about a fortnight;
but I am sure the others will come too fast upon me. If
you could come to town in ten days, I think we could so
settle the matter, as for it not to be at all, or at least but
very little inconvenient to you, and to relieve my mind
from a load of vexation and anxiety that is really
intolerable.</p>

<p>“The works are all going on well. I have made a
revolution here at any rate. I have not seen Wright this
fortnight; but I make him send every word of copy to <i>me</i>.
I have dismissed his journeyman-authors and bottle-companions,
and have set him to work for his bread. And
work he shall, or I will dismiss him. Considerable as
my property is, I had been well-nigh ruined, if I had not
come to jail. Let me have a line from you. Mrs. Cobbett
joins me in kindest regards to Mrs. Swann and your
dear children. We thank you very much for the pig;
but I thank you still more for your last kind and affectionate
letter, the words of which, and the whole of your
conduct, have made an impression upon my heart that
never will be effaced. Amongst the other acts of this man
was an attempt to put an end to <i>our</i> connexion, when once
he had got you to take the notes; but he was silenced
by an indignant rejection of the hint on my part. The
best way will be to say little about the matter anywhere;
for the shame of being so duped is mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“God bless you, and give you health, and the like to
your family.”</p>

</div>

<p>It was all too late, however. Years of prosperity,
with concurrent retrenchment, might have staved
off ruin. But, as the ensuing period in the history
of England was one of continued disaster to most
persons who were not paid out of the taxes, Mr.
Cobbett shared the fate of all persons who were
not prepared for the storm; and his pecuniary
affairs only got from bad to worse. As for the 6500<i>l.</i>
due from Wright under the arbitration, there was
not the ghost of a chance of that ever being paid.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, then, it is not surprising
to learn that he had already accepted the
proffered assistance of his political friends. Colonel
Bosville gave him 1000<i>l.</i> as a set-off against some
electioneering expenses he had been put to over
Mr. Paull; Burdett advanced a large sum chiefly
for the purpose of settling with Mr. Swann; and,
at last, when the fine had to be paid, it would
appear that Cobbett owed the ability to do so to
the generosity of another. This disposition to
support him and his cause showed itself, however,
from the very first, and from all quarters. Even
his opponents could not fail to admit the severity
of the sentence;<a name="FNanchor_7_58" id="FNanchor_7_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_58" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> while his friends not only offered
their sympathy, but proposed a public subscription
on his behalf&mdash;a proposal, however, which Cobbett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
declined, at the same time suggesting that those
who wished to assist him could not do better than
buy the <i>Register</i>.</p>

<p>The end came at last. In compliment to Mr.
Cobbett’s untiring industry, and the abundant
material provided for its exercise, Old Time had
worn his fleetest pair of wings. And on the 8th
July, 1812, his last paper in Newgate announced
that he had “just paid a thousand pounds to the
king: and much good may it do his majesty!”</p>

<p>On the following day, being released, a grand
dinner was given at the “Crown and Anchor,” in
order to celebrate the occasion; and, as though Fate
were determined that he should have no interval of
peace, as soon as he had regained his liberty, the
opportunity must needs be taken to remind Mr. Cobbett
that his opinions had changed from time to time.
Burdett took the chair, presiding over some six
hundred guests, and the thing was fairly successful,
notwithstanding an attempt made to create discord
between Cobbett and the chairman of the evening.
There was no blinking the fact, however, that
Cobbett had lost some friends over the vacillation
which he had displayed while within the grasp of
Vicary Gibbs; but the ungenerous mortal, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
brought the matter forward at the dinner, had no
support from his audience; and, indeed, all the
leaders among the Reformists<a name="FNanchor_8_59" id="FNanchor_8_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_59" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> had condoned the
momentary weakness.</p>

<p>Mr. Cobbett’s release was celebrated, in several
places in England, by a public meeting of one
kind or other. And as he journeyed homeward,
his reception was well-calculated to add to the
felicities of the day. At Alton, the bells were set
ringing; at Winchester he was stopped to be
again entertained at dinner; and, on nearing home,
he found the people of Botley had come out in
goodly assemblage to meet him, and to listen to
his story.</p>

Poor Bill was a measure brought before Parliament, early in 1811,
for the purpose of enabling the directors of the union to compel the
poor, whether asking relief or not, to go into the workhouse. They
were to be allowed to enter houses at their discretion to search for
vagrants. They might commit to solitary imprisonment, without
limit, the poor whom they collected, and <i>administer moderate correction</i>
for misbehaviour! (<i>Vide</i> Parliamentary Debates, March 26,
1811.) This brutal idea was soon snuffed out, at the instance of
Sir Samuel Romilly; but what a picture does it not present, of the
combination of imbecility and cruelty which could rule the minds of
some of the potential classes of society!</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_55" id="Footnote_4_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_55"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Francis Maseres (1731-1824), Cursitor Baron of the Exchequer,
came of a Huguenot family, and was a man of high cultivation,
being especially distinguished for his mathematical attainments
and his knowledge of English constitutional history.
Although his name is now almost forgotten, he produced a number
of short essays and treatises on his favourite subjects, many of
which, however, are buried away in the newspapers of his time,
Cobbett’s <i>Porcupine</i> being one to which he contributed. Maseres
was a moderate Reformer, and what opinions he had were rather
allowed to filtrate through his own select circle of friends than
pushed forward into naked notoriety. He pursued a quiet, intellectual
life, and devoted a large portion of his means to charitable and
liberal purposes. Cobbett never mentions his name without affectionate
reverence.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_56" id="Footnote_5_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_56"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> This work was begun shortly after Cobbett’s arrival in Newgate.
His contention was that the Bank could never again pay in
specie or in paper at par, unless the interest on the Funds was
reduced. The loans having been contracted to a large extent in
paper, this seemed reasonable enough; and the idea was generally
accepted among the classes who suffered so severely from monetary
pressure during subsequent years, although others thought it was
“sapping the foundations of public morality,” and so on.
</p>
<p>
The first letter appeared in the <i>Register</i> of Sept. 1, 1810, under
the title of “Paper against Gold; being an Examination of the
Report of the Bullion Committee; in a Series of Letters to the
Tradesmen and Farmers in and near Salisbury.” It was afterwards
reprinted in full, with additions, under the title of “Paper against
Gold, and Glory against Prosperity” (retail price, twenty shillings,
in paper money).
</p>
<p>
During the remainder of Cobbett’s life, he was always at battledore
and shuttlecock over the Currency question. A passage from
one of his American <i>Registers</i> was one that he was especially fond of
sending up, in which he declared that it would be impossible to
carry Peel’s Bill of 1819 into full effect, and wound up with an offer
to Castlereagh to have leave “to lay me on a gridiron and broil me
alive, while Sidmouth may stir the coals, and Canning stand by and
laugh at my groans.” The Bill did take effect, after a fashion, but
with tremendous difficulties in its train; and the feast of the gridiron
came off at last, on the 9th of April, 1826, not in the style that was
originally proposed, but in the shape of a dinner at the London
Tavern. For a full account of it see the <i>Morning Herald</i> of the
following day.
</p>
<p>
Another bit of humour was an attempt in verse:&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Of paper coin how vast the pow’r!</div>
<div class="verse">It breaks or makes us in an hour.</div>

<div class="verse">And tumble fifty nobles down!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
When Cobbett took the house at 183, Fleet Street, he prepared a
big gridiron as a shop-sign, and also headed his journal with a
woodcut of that utensil.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_57" id="Footnote_6_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_57"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Mr. Wright employed his later years in miscellaneous literary
work, and died in the year 1844. For a notice of him, <i>vide Gentleman’s
Magazine</i> of that year.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_59" id="Footnote_8_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_59"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Excepting Mr. Leigh Hunt. The <i>Examiner</i> again took up its
tale about Mr. Cobbett’s “dastardly spirit,” which, it was quite
clear, still existed, for the latter had not dared to whisper a syllable
against the pernicious habits of the Prince of Wales, nor against the
reappointment of the Duke of York. Cobbett was at the same time
charged, by the same writer, with “almost holding up the murderer
of Perceval to applause and imitation”&mdash;a statement which was the
<i>exact opposite</i> to the truth. A further insinuation, that Lord
Cochrane held guineas up to the electors, was of similar malignity
and worthlessness. A pamphlet appeared, about this time, upbraiding
those who had been latterly seizing upon the opportunity to
vilify Cobbett’s character: “An Examination of the Attacks upon
the Political Character of Mr. Cobbett,” by George Buckler
(London, 1812).</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="smaller">“THE NATION NEVER CAN BE ITSELF AGAIN
WITHOUT A REFORM.”</span></h2>

<p>There is reason to believe that Mr. Cobbett now
began seriously to entertain the idea of getting
into Parliament. Beyond, however, an address to
the electors of Hampshire, in the autumn of 1812,
no active step was yet taken. Mr. George Rose
was all-powerful in the county, the constituency
being thus practically in ministerial hands. One
appearance on the nomination-day was enough
to satisfy Mr. Cobbett of the hopelessness of a
contest.</p>

<p>His return to Botley revealed one great change
in sentiment; the parsons were dead against him.
This was undeserved, as Cobbett had always been
a good, quiet churchman; had written vigorously
in support of tithes, and the prior claim to them of
the clergy and the poor, as against the Howards,
the Russells, and the Greys; and had had many
friends amongst the clergy. This new alienation
may, however, be due to a circumstance which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
occurred just before Cobbett’s release;&mdash;it was certainly
so in one case.</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Eaton, a small bookseller, and an old
offender against established opinion, had recently
stood in the pillory for an hour,&mdash;that being part of
his punishment for selling Paine’s “Age of Reason.”
There was much public sympathy with him, the
populace actually trying to serve him with “refreshments.”
Cobbett had formed pretty strong
opinions concerning this degrading punishment,
but very much stronger ones concerning the
Attorney-General as a prosecutor; and that learned
gentleman having foreboded the “consequences,
dreadful in the extreme,” which must follow if
Paine’s religious principles were suffered to take
root, Mr. Cobbett suggested that there would be
no better way of averting these consequences than
by an answer to the book. “And have we 20,000
clergymen, and will no one of them attempt to
give us this answer?” he said. He would call upon
his own spiritual pastor, the Rector of Botley, the
Rev. Richard Baker.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker consented to undertake the task, but
almost immediately withdrew the offer; upon which,
Mr. Cobbett reminded him of his ordination vows,
and generally played with him, in his own manner,
making the poor parson look rather ridiculous.</p>

<p>So, upon his return home, Mr. Cobbett was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
welcomed by his spiritual adviser; who even went
so far as to refuse the keys of the belfry to those
persons who, just then, were so desirous of adding
all they could to the clamour of rejoicing.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Baker is a character, in his way.
There are some sad stories of him in Cobbett’s
<i>Register</i>, which the reader may discover, if his
tastes lie in that direction. How he was horsewhipped
in the public street,&mdash;how he actually professed
disbelief in Revelation, while declining to
meet the consequences of a public admission of the
same,&mdash;how he cheated at market, and so on.<a name="FNanchor_1_60" id="FNanchor_1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_60" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>There were many such characters in the Church
in those deadened days, who, when they entered
into the lively election contests of the time, would
lead the way of violence. Your political parson
could be a famous “rough,” when opportunity served.</p>

<p>So Mr. Cobbett had made another set of enemies&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
very set, too, who, if they had given themselves
a moment’s opportunity for consideration,
would have discovered that he, of all public men, was
the one who could serve their cause the best. Instead
of that, numbers of the clergy started up as anti-Cobbettites,
writing useless tracts on “disaffection,”
or meeting him at public gatherings, and trying to
shout him down. And this sort of thing lasted as
long as Cobbett lived; the clergy never made friends
with him again; there were far too many idle
shepherds, who thought their interest must suffer
if a misguided populace had all that it asked; and
who, consequently, resisted Reform with all their
might and main.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The country squires were dreading, too, the
possible effects of Mr. Cobbett’s vigorous writings.</p>

<p>His influence amongst the middle-classes was
increasing; and the artisans and labourers were
beginning to club together to buy the <i>Register</i>;
readers were more numerous than ever.<a name="FNanchor_2_61" id="FNanchor_2_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_61" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But the
landed interest could not, or would not, understand
him. The farmer could not see the identity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
interest which properly existed between himself
and his labourers; and the man who preached
this theme was, of course, not to be trusted when
dealing with other topics. He told them that ruin
was impending; that, immediately upon a cessation
of the war, prices would go down, and the consequences
would be disastrous. There was no
chance of escape, but by immediate Reform, by
which means there should be a searching reduction
in the public expenditure. The poor-rates were
now nearly eight millions. Government annuitants
were swelling their numbers with every year of
war; dignitaries of state had higher salaries, and
courtiers larger pensions; army-contractors and
stock-jobbers were swallowing up the wealth of the
country, and elbowing out the squires.</p>

<p>So, when the Corn Bill was proposed, Mr.
Cobbett was standing alone again, or very nearly
alone.<a name="FNanchor_3_62" id="FNanchor_3_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_62" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In vain did he point out that it would tend
to keep up the high price of food, which was
already driving the able-bodied out of the country;
that the principal reason for keeping up
high prices was, that the land might continue to
pay the exorbitant taxes, and so continue to support
a multitude of idlers. The Corn Bill became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
law; peace was signed, but plenty came not along
with it; and the farmers straightway fell to pieces,
dragging all the industry of the country along with
them.</p>

<p>During these three or four years (1812-1816),
there was more revolution in personal property in
England, than there had been seen, in the same
space of time, since the Restoration. The terrible
load which weighed upon the people may be judged
of by the fact that Cobbett was paying, the year
after the war, several hundred pounds in direct
and indirect taxes. It is not difficult, then, to
understand how intolerable would be the burden
upon the land, for people whose only resource was
the land; and all the more so, that inflated prosperity
had engendered improvidence. Tea, coffee,
wine, spirits, and other exciseable articles had taken
the place of beer on the tables of the farmers;
their wives and daughters had found sofas, carpets,
and parlour-bells necessary to existence. A
generation had grown up which must needs <i>send</i>
its butter and eggs to market, instead of carrying
them; silk stockings had usurped those of
worsted; the fashions were finding their way into
the farm-houses. So, in a little while, the poor
farmers were breaking stones on the highway by
hundreds.</p>

<p>But, if t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>he <span class="smcapuc">LAND</span> did not, as yet, understand Mr.
Cobbett, the <span class="smcap">Workshop</span> did. Very soon after he
came out of prison, he drew the attention of his
readers to the ominous disturbance at Nottingham,
on the part of the Luddites. The change which
had come over the people&mdash;that they should break
machinery, disturb the peace, and refuse to sing
“God save the King”&mdash;was ominous indeed. But
how did this come to pass? Not all at once: these
things (he pointed out) had been growing up by
degrees. Disloyalty and misgovernment ever went
hand in hand. The people were beginning to see
that the governing classes were occupied, as
much as any traders, in looking exclusively after
their own interests, and the interests of their
adherents.</p>

<p>For an effectual remedy, then, there could only
be a reform in the Representation of the people.
No innovation: but Reform. No republicanism:
but the ancient Constitution. “The nation never
can be itself again without a Reform,” was Cobbett’s
repeated cry,&mdash;echoed, at last, by millions of
people.<a name="FNanchor_4_63" id="FNanchor_4_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_63" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The brave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> the undaunted Lord Cochrane was
one of Mr. Cobbett’s coadjutors. They had been
near neighbours for many years past; and when
the gallant sailor was ashore, many had been the
sports which they had seen together. Cochrane’s
candidature for Westminster always had the
valuable support of the <i>Register</i>; and, when the
foul charge was got up against him (purely from
political motives) which hung like a nightmare over
the rest of his long life, there was no support of his
cause equal to the pages of that intrepid journal.
So the two men kept together&mdash;had long and
earnest conferences over the miserable and degraded
condition of their country; and worked
and waited for the day that must surely come
after all this suffering. The nation was now
entering upon the most disgraceful period of its
history: with a disreputable “first gent” in the
chief seat; the pretenders to statesmanship divided
into two rival factions, concerning which it can
only be said that one was in place and had control
over the country’s resources, and the other was out of
place; and the mass of the people in a condition,
comparable only to that presented by the inhabitants
of a hive of bees, in autumn, when their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
winter store passes into the hands of other than the
providers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day, in September, 1816, after a spring and
summer of much trial, during which the country
was kept alarmed by acts of violence; mills, frames,
and threshing-machines being destroyed, and ricks
of corn laid hands on, either by fire or thieves;
Cobbett had been talking to his neighbour on these
burning topics. They both agreed that, if the
people could but be enabled to see the matter in its
true light, there would be “an end to all such acts
of violence, at once; and of course, to the ignominious
deaths of fathers and sons, and the miseries
of wives, children, and parents, produced in the end
by these acts of violence.” Lord Cochrane’s suggestion
was, that it was in the power of Mr. Cobbett
to effect this purpose, by writing an essay upon the
subject; and, if the price of the <i>Register</i> could for
that occasion be reduced to twopence, the desired
object would be obtained.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I said, before we parted, that this should be done.
But, as it was impossible for me to prove to the people
what was <i>not</i> the cause of their misery, without proving
to them what <i>was</i> the cause … without pointing out
the <i>remedy</i>: as the remedy, at last, came to a Reform of
Parliament; and, as I still feared that the best time was
not come for urging on this great question, I delayed,
from time to time, the fulfilment of my promise to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
neighbour, who, on his part, never saw me without pressing
me hard upon the subject; and on the 2nd of
November, I wrote the No. 18, being an ‘Address to the
Journeymen and Labourers’ on the aforementioned subjects.”</p>

</div>

<p>There were misgivings as to the probable success
of this effort: that there would be serious loss in its
production, and that it would be premature; irresolution
went so far as to countermand the instructions
to the printer. Futile misgivings these!
Before the end of the month, forty-four thousand
copies had been sold of the first cheap <i>Register</i>.</p>

<p>And, reader, if you glance at some portions of
this splendid essay, you will not wonder at the
uproar that ensued; the enthusiastic reception on
the part of the “lower orders;” the terror on the
part of officialism and prescription; the renewed
malignity of the envious press. The effect of this
popularizing of the <i>Political Register</i> was prodigious,
as we shall see; and as you will understand, if all
the numbers were anything like this first one.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">To the Journeymen and Labourers of England,
Wales, Scotland, and Ireland</span>, on the cause of their
present miseries; on the measures which have produced
that cause; on the remedies which some foolish and some
cruel and insolent men have proposed; and on the line
of conduct which journeymen and labourers ought to
pursue, in order to obtain effectual relief, and to assist in
promoting the tranquillity, and restoring the happ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>iness of
their country.</p>

<p>“Friends and Fellow-Countrymen,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Whatever the pride of rank, of riches, or of scholarship,
may have induced some men to believe, or to affect
to believe, the real strength and all the resources of a
country ever have sprung, and ever must spring, from the
<i>labour</i> of its people, and hence it is, that this nation,
which is so small in numbers, and so poor in climate and
soil compared with many others, has, for many ages, been
the most powerful nation in the world: it is the most
industrious, the most laborious, and, therefore, the most
powerful. Elegant dresses, superb furniture, stately
buildings, fine roads and canals, fleet horses and carriages,
numerous and stout ships, warehouses teeming with
goods; all these, and many other objects that fall under
our view, are so many works of national wealth and
resources. But all these spring from <i>labour</i>. Without
the journeyman and the labourer none of them could
exist; without the assistance of their hands, the country
would be a wilderness, hardly worth the notice of an
invader.</p>

<p>“As it is the labour of those who toil which makes a
country abound in resources, so it is the same class of men
who must, by their arms, secure its safety, and uphold its
fame. Titles and immense sums of money have been
bestowed upon numerous naval and military commanders.
Without calling the justice of these in question, we may
assert that the victories were obtained by you and your
fathers, and brothers and sons, in co-operation with those
commanders, who, with <i>your</i> aid, have done great and
wonderful things; but who, without that aid, would have
been as impotent as children at the breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“With this correct idea of your own worth in your minds,
with what indignation must you hear yourselves called
the populace, the rabble, the mob, the swinish multitude;
and with what greater indignation, if possible, must you
hear the projects of these cool, and cruel, and insolent
men, who, now that you have been, without any fault of
yours, brought into a state of misery, propose to narrow
the limits of parish relief, to prevent you from marrying
in the days of your youth, or to thrust you out to seek
your bread in foreign lands, never more to behold your
parents or friends? But, suppress your indignation, until
we return to this topic, after we have considered the
<i>cause</i> of your present misery, and the measures which have
produced that cause.</p>

<p>“The times in which we live are full of peril. The
nation, as described by the very creatures of the Government,
is fast advancing to that period when an important
change must take place. It is the lot of mankind, that
some shall labour with their limbs, and others with their
minds; and, on all occasions, more especially on an
occasion like the present, it is the duty of the latter to
come to the assistance of the former. We are all equally
interested in the peace and happiness of our common
country. It is of the utmost importance, that in the
seeking to obtain those objects, our endeavours should be
uniform, and tend all to the same point. Such an
uniformity cannot exist without an uniformity of sentiment
as to public matters, and to produce this uniformity is the
object of this address.</p>

<p>“As to the cause of our present miseries, it is <i>the
enormous amount of the taxes</i>, which the Government compels
us to pay for the support of its army, its placemen,
its pensioners, &amp;c., and for the payment of the interest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
its debt. That this is the real cause has been a thousand
times proved; and it is now so acknowledged by the
creatures of the Government themselves. Two hundred
and five of the correspondents of the Board of Agriculture
ascribe the ruin of the country to <i>taxation</i>. Numerous
writers, formerly the friends of the Pitt system, now
declare, that taxation has been the cause of our distress.
Indeed, when we compare our present state to the state
of the country previous to the wars against France, we
must see that our present misery is owing to no other
cause. The taxes then annually raised amounted to
about fifteen millions: they amounted last year to seventy
millions. The nation was then happy: it is now miserable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“It has been attempted to puzzle you with this sort of
question: ‘If taxes be the cause of the people’s misery,
how comes it that they were not so miserable before the
taxes were reduced as they are now?’ Here is a fallacy,
which you will be careful to detect. I know that the
taxes have been reduced, that is to say, <i>nominally</i> reduced,
but not so in fact; on the contrary, they have in reality
been greatly augmented. This has been done by <i>the
sleight of hand</i> of paper-money. Suppose, for instance,
that four years ago I had 100 pounds to pay in taxes, then
130 bushels of wheat would have paid my share. If I
have <i>now</i> seventy-five pounds to pay in taxes, it will
require 190 bushels of wheat to pay my share of taxes.
Consequently, though my taxes are nominally reduced,
they are, in reality, greatly augmented. This has been
done by the legerdemain of paper-money. In 1812, the
pound note was worth only thirteen shillings in silver. It
is now worth twenty shillings. Therefore, when we no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>w
pay a pound note to the tax-gatherer, we really pay him
twenty shillings, where we before paid him thirteen
shillings; and the fund-holders who lent pound notes
worth thirteen shillings each, are now paid their interest
in pounds worth twenty shillings each. And the thing
is come to what Sir Francis Burdett told the parliament
it would come to. He told them, in 1811, that if they
ever attempted to pay the interest of their debt in gold
and silver, or in paper-money equal in value to gold and
silver, the farmers and tradesmen must be ruined, and the
journeymen and labourers reduced to the last stage of
misery.</p>

<p>“Thus, then, it is clear that it is the weight of the taxes,
under which you are sinking, which has already pressed
so many of you down into the state of paupers, and which
now threatens to deprive many of you of your existence.
We next come to consider what have been <i>the causes</i> of
this weight of taxes. Here we must go back a little in
our history; and you will soon see that this intolerable
weight has all proceeded from <i>the want of a parliamentary
Reform</i>.</p>

<p>“In the year 1764, soon after the present king came to
the throne, the annual interest of the debt amounted to
about five millions, and the whole of the taxes to about
nine millions. But, soon after this, a war was entered on
to compel the Americans to submit to be taxed by the
parliament, <i>without being represented in that parliament</i>.
The Americans triumphed, and, after the war was over,
the annual interest of the debt amounted to about nine
millions, and the whole of the taxes to about fifteen
millions. This was our situation when the French
people began their Revolution. The French people had
so long been the slaves of a despotic Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>, that the
friends of freedom in England rejoiced at their emancipation.
The cause of <i>reform</i>, which had never ceased to
have supporters in England for a great many years, now
acquired new life, and the Reformers urged the parliament
to <i>grant reform</i>, instead of going to war against the people
of France. The Reformers said: ‘Give the nation <i>reform</i>,
and you need fear no <i>revolution</i>.’ The parliament, instead
of listening to the Reformers, crushed them, and went to
war against the people of France; and the consequence
of these wars is, that the annual interest of the debt now
amounts to forty-five millions, and the whole of the taxes,
during each of the last several years, to seventy millions.
So that these wars have added thirty-six millions a year
to the interest of the debt, and fifty-five millions a year
to the amount of the whole of the taxes! This is the
price that we have paid for having checked (for it is only
<i>checked</i>) the progress of liberty in France; for having
forced upon that people the family of Bourbon, and for
having enabled another branch of that same family to
restore the bloody Inquisition which Napoleon had put
down.”</p>

</div>

<p>After a graphic sketch of the oppressions and
the struggles, which obtained in France, and which
produced the great Revolution, the writer proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It seems, at first sight, very strange that the Government
should not have taken warning in time. But it had
so long been in the habit of <i>despising the people</i>, that its
mind was incapable of entertaining any notion of danger
from the oppressions heaped upon them. It was surrounded
with panders and parasites, who told it nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
but flattering falsehoods; and it saw itself supported by
250,000 bayonets, which it thought irresistible.… And
if you ask me how the ministers, and the noblesse, and
the priesthood, who generally know pretty well how to
take care of themselves; if you ask me how it came to
pass that they did not <i>take warning in time</i>, I answer,
that they <i>did</i> take warning, but that, seeing that the
change which was coming would deprive them of a great
part of their power and emoluments, they resolved to
<i>resist the change</i>, and to destroy the country, if possible,
rather than not have all its wealth and power to themselves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“You have been represented by the <i>Times</i> newspaper,
by the <i>Courier</i>, by the <i>Morning Post</i>, by the <i>Morning
Herald</i>, and others, as the Scum of Society. They say
that you have no business at public meetings; that you
are rabble, and that you pay no taxes. These insolent
hirelings, who wallow in wealth, would not be able to put
their abuse of you in print, were it not for your labour.
You create all that is an object of taxation; for, even the
land itself would be good for nothing without your labour.
But are you <i>not</i> taxed? Do you pay no taxes? One of
the correspondents of the Board of Agriculture has said
that care has been taken to lay as little tax as possible on
the articles used by you. One would wonder how a man
could be found impudent enough to put an assertion like
this upon paper. But the people of this country have so
long been insulted by such men, that the insolence of the
latter knows no bounds.</p>

<p>“The tax-gatherers do not, indeed, come to you and
demand money of you; but there are few articles which
you use, in the purchase of which you do not pay a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> tax.
On your shoes, salt, beer, malt, hops, tea, sugar, candles,
soap, paper, coffee, spirits, glass of your windows, bricks
and tiles, tobacco. On all these, and many other articles,
you pay a tax, and even on your loaf you pay a tax,
because everything is taxed from which the loaf proceeds.
In several cases the tax amounts to more than one-half
of what you pay for the article itself; these taxes go, in
part, to support sinecure placemen and pensioners; and
the ruffians of the hired press call you the Scum of Society,
and deny that you have any right to show your faces
at any public meeting to petition for a Reform, or
for the removal of any abuse whatever! Mr. Preston,
whom I quoted before, and who is a member of parliament,
and has a large estate, says upon this subject,
‘Every family, even of the poorest labourer, consisting of
five persons, may be considered as paying in indirect
taxes, at least ten pounds a year, or more than half his
wages at seven shillings a week!’ And yet the insolent
hirelings call you the <i>mob</i>, the <i>rabble</i>, the <i>scum</i>, the
<i>swinish multitude</i>, and say that your voice is nothing;
that you have no business at public meetings; and that
you are, and ought to be, considered as nothing in the
body politic! Shall we never see the day when these
men will change their tone? Will they never cease to
look upon you as brutes? I trust they will change their
tone, and that the day of the change is <i>at no great distance</i>!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“With what feelings must you look upon the condition
of your country, where the increase of the people is now
looked upon as a curse! Thus, however, has it always
been, in all countries, where taxes have produced excessive
misery. Our countryman, Mr. Gibbon, in his history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, has the
following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘The horrid practice of murdering their new-born
infants was become every day more frequent in the provinces.
It was the effect of <i>distress</i>, and the distress was
principally occasioned by the intolerable burden of taxes,
and by the vexations as well as cruel prosecutions of the
officers of the Revenue against their insolvent debtors.
The less opulent or less industrious part of mankind,
instead of rejoicing at an increase of family, deemed it an
act of paternal tenderness to release the children from the
impending miseries of a life which they themselves were
unable to support.’</p>

<p>“But that which took place under the base Emperor
Constantine, will not take place in England. You will
not murder your new-born infants, nor will you, to please
the corrupt and the insolent, debar yourselves from enjoyments
to which you are invited by the very first of nature’s
laws. It is, however, a disgrace to the country, that men
should be found in it, capable of putting ideas so insolent
upon paper. So, then, a young man arm-in-arm with a
rosy-cheeked girl, must be a spectacle of evil omen!
What! and do they imagine that you are thus to be <i>extinguished</i>,
because some of you are now (without any fault
of yours) unable to find work? As far as you were
wanted to labour, to fight, or to pay taxes, you were welcome,
and they boasted of your numbers; but now that
your country has been brought into a state of misery,
these corrupt and insolent men are busied with schemes
for getting rid of you. Just as if you had not as good a
right to live, and to love, and to marry as they have!
They do not purpose&mdash;far from it&mdash;to check the breeding
of sinecure placemen and pensioners, who are supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in part by the taxes which you help to pay. They say
not a word about the <i>whole families</i> who are upon the
pension list. In many cases, there are sums granted in
trust for the children of such a lord or such a lady. And
while labourers and journeymen, who have large families
too, are actually paying taxes for the support of these
lords’ and ladies’ children, these cruel and insolent men
propose that they shall have no relief, and their having
children ought to be <i>checked</i>! To such a subject no
words can do justice. You will feel as you ought to feel;
and to the effect of your feelings I leave these cruel and
insolent men.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following paragraph is against the republicans,
of which there were many advocates, born
of the troublous times:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I know of no enemy of reform, and of the happiness
of the country, so great as that man who would persuade
you that we possess <i>nothing good</i>, and that all must be
torn to pieces. There is no principle, no precedent, no
regulation (except as to mere matter of detail), favourable
to freedom, which is not to be found in the laws
of England or in the example of our ancestors. Therefore,
I say, we may ask for, and we want, <i>nothing new</i>.
We have great constitutional laws and principles, to
which we are immovably attached. We want great
<i>alteration</i>, but we want nothing new. Alteration, modification
to suit the times and circumstances; but the
great principles ought to be, and must be, the same, or
else confusion will follow. It was the misfortune of the
French people, that they had no great and settled principles
to refer to in their laws or history. They sallied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
forth and inflicted vengeance on their oppressors; but,
for want of settled principles to which to refer, they fell
into confusion; they massacred each other; they next
flew to a military chief to protect them even against
themselves; and the result has been what we too well
know. Let us, therefore, congratulate ourselves, that
we have great constitutional principles and laws, to
which we can refer, and to which we are attached.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When journeymen find their wages reduced, they should
take time to <i>reflect on the real cause</i> before they fly upon
their employers, who are, in many cases, in as great, or
greater, distress than themselves. How many of these
employers have, of late, gone to jail for debt, and left
helpless families behind them! The employer’s trade
falls off. His goods are reduced in price. His stock
loses the half of its value. He owes money. He is
ruined; and how can he continue to pay high wages?
The cause of his ruin is the <i>weight of the taxes</i>, which
presses so heavily on us all, that we lose the power of
purchasing goods. But it is certain that a great many,
a very large portion, of the farmers, tradesmen, and
manufacturers, have, by their supineness and want of
public spirit, contributed towards the bringing of this
ruin upon themselves and upon you. They have <i>skulked</i>
from their public duty. They have kept aloof from, or
opposed, all measures for a redress of grievances; and,
indeed, they still skulk, though ruin and destruction
stare them in the face.… Instead of coming forward
to apply for a reduction of those taxes which are pressing
them as well as you to the earth, what are they doing?
Why, they are applying to the Government to add to
their receipts by passing <i>Corn Bills</i>; by preven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>ting
<i>foreign wool</i> from being imported; and many other such
silly schemes. Instead of asking for a reduction of
taxes, they are asking for the <i>means of paying taxes</i>!
Instead of asking for the abolition of sinecure places and
pensions, they pray to be enabled to continue to pay the
amount of those places and pensions! They know very
well that the salaries of the judges and of many other
persons were greatly raised, some years ago, on the
ground of the rise in the price of labour and provisions;
why, then, do they not ask to have those salaries <i>reduced</i>
now that <i>labour</i> is reduced? Why do they not apply to
the case of the judges and others, the arguments which
they apply to you? They can talk boldly enough to
you; but they are too great cowards to talk to the
Government, even in the way of petition!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have no room, nor have I any desire, to appeal to your
passions upon this occasion. I have laid before you,
with all the clearness I am master of, the causes of our
misery, the measures which have led to those causes,
and I have pointed out what appears to me to be the
only remedy&mdash;namely, a reform of the Commons’, or
people’s, House of Parliament. I exhort you to proceed
in a peaceable and lawful manner; but, at the same
time, to proceed with zeal and resolution in the attainment
of this object. If the skulkers will not join you, if
the ‘decent fire-side’ gentry still keep aloof, proceed by
yourselves. Any man can draw up a petition, and any
man can carry it up to London, with instructions to
deliver it into trusty hands, to be presented whenever
the House shall meet. Some further information as to
this matter in a future number. In the meanwhile, I
remain, your friend, <span class="smcap">Wm. Cobbett</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Such, then, was the clarion, which was to awaken
the working-classes of England; to systematize
their thoughts, and to give definiteness to their aims.</p>

<p>And such was, also, the stuff which was to
terrify, for a little while longer, our dear old friends
“Law and Order.” While the hundreds of thousands
were welcoming this new gospel, were learning
a practicable path for their bewildered feet:
the partisans of Government were absolutely
dazed, blinded, with terror; and their horror at
the growth of liberal opinions (otherwise, “the
floodgates of sedition”) completely disabled them
from discussing domestic politics with any semblance
of calmness. As for the mediocrities in
power,&mdash;they had succeeded in keeping out the
shifty Whigs; but here was a third party coming
to the front, with claims as good as their own, and
promising to acquire a force which they might
withstand in vain. Ministers, in short, were
alarmed; and they announced their resolve, in
the words of Lord Liverpool, to pursue the “Stern
path of Duty!” Lord Sidmouth (now Home
Secretary), whose qualities for statesmanship no
person, other than his royal patron, had been
able to discover since he left the Speaker’s chair
in 1802,&mdash;was at his wits’ end. And minor lights,
as Mr. Wilberforce, sighed and groaned over so
much blasphemy as was rife, Cobbett’s being “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
most pernicious of all.”</p>

<p>The course of the Stern Path, as regards the
subject of these pages, must be described in another
chapter. Meanwhile, the immediate consequences
of the publication of the first cheap <i>Register</i>
remain to be noted.</p>

<p>All sorts of means were taken to hinder the
circulation of the now ubiquitous journal. Booksellers
who sold the <i>Register</i> were threatened with
loss of custom; publicans were threatened with
the withdrawal of their licences; hawkers and
pedlars were threatened with the police.</p>

<p>Cheap opposition pamphlets were started.<a name="FNanchor_5_64" id="FNanchor_5_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_64" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
newspapers, which had been pretty quiet concerning
Mr. Cobbett’s merits, ever since 1812, now
began again:<a name="FNanchor_6_65" id="FNanchor_6_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_65" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the <i>New Times</i> coming out with a
specially grand affair, headed “<span class="smcap">Cobbett</span> against
<span class="smcap">Cobbett</span>,” which was subsequently issued as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
broadside.</p>

<p>And a very serious charge did they bring
against this “<i>convicted libeller</i>,” this “<i>firebrand</i>,”
this “<i>brutal ruffian</i>,” this “<i>convicted incendiary</i>,”
this “<i>hoary miscreant</i>,” and his “<i>ferocious journal</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_7_66" id="FNanchor_7_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_66" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
In what, then, had he manifested this brutality,&mdash;this
ferocity? By lacerating the naked back of
another of his labourers? Running off with another
man’s wife? Setting fire to barns and ricks?
Defrauding the stock-exchange?</p>

<p>None, none of these things. The criminal was
proved, by overwhelming evidence,&mdash;“out of his
own mouth” indeed&mdash;to have formerly denounced
Reform!!! Sad fellow!</p>

who wanted his people to work, on some special occasion, on a
Sunday, agreeing beforehand to pay them double. The day’s work
being done, a grand dinner was provided, during which C. went
round the table and put everybody’s money in front of him. This

<p>
“Hampshire.&mdash;Mr. Cobbett continues to write his celebrated
<i>Political Register</i> from his estate at Botley, in this county, uniting in
his own person, in their completest sense, the character of agriculturist,
patriot, and man of letters. Some of his late numbers, on
the novel positions and pretensions of the belligerent powers, are
distinguished above all his former writings for their masculine eloquence,
power of reasoning, and courageous delineation of truth.”&mdash;<i>Monthly

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_62" id="Footnote_3_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_62"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Cobbett got up a requisition for a county meeting, but the High
Sheriff refused to entertain the plan. Being thus foiled, he actually
sent up a petition to the House of Lords, praying them not to pass
any law to prohibit or restrain the importation of corn. Earl Stanhope
was prepared to present the petition, but received it too late.</p>

became of great authority; they were read on nearly every cottage
hearth in the manufacturing districts of South Lancashire, in those
of Leicester, Derby, and Nottingham; also in many of the Scotch
manufacturing towns. Their influence was speedily visible; he
directed his readers to the true cause of their sufferings&mdash;misgovernment;
and to its proper corrective&mdash;Parliamentary reform. Riots
soon became scarce, and from that time they have never obtained
their ancient vogue with the labourers of this country.… Instead
of riots and destruction of property, Hampden clubs were now
established in many of our large towns and the villages and districts
around them. Cobbett’s books were printed in a cheap form; the
labourers read them, and thenceforward became deliberate and
systematic in their proceedings.”&mdash;Samuel Bamford: “Passages in

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="smaller">“BETWEEN SILENCE AND A DUNGEON LAY
MY ONLY CHOICE.”</span></h2>

<p>When your wife, or your nurse, or your mother-in-law,
utters that reproach of hers, “Ah, I told
you how it would be!”&mdash;the spirit within you is
not apt to be tinged with a pervading gratefulness.</p>

<p>Similarly, “a man is not likely to be thanked
who calls attention to the vast discrepancies
between the theory and practice of the Constitution”
(as one of our later philosophers remarks).
What with the impertinence of the thing&mdash;the
implied assertion of superiority&mdash;the further implication
of failure and muddle on the part of the
prescriptive interpreters of the Constitution: the
counsel offered by outsiders is rejected with disdain,
or put down to anything but disinterested
motives.</p>

<p>The shortsightedness and illiberality of the
Eldon and Sidmouth type of statesmanship was
constantly displayed in this way. Let there be a
Reform petition offered to Parliament, and they
would refuse to receive it, if, by any means, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>me
technical objection could be raised. Given a civic
state dinner, and the ministers would absent themselves
if they disagreed with the Lord Mayor’s
politics. Let a Sunday paper advocate the correction
of financial abuses, and the suspicion is at
once raised that the grievance really lies in not
having a share of the spoil. Genuine men like
Whitbread and Romilly, Roebuck and Cobden, have
not always escaped similar imputation, from which
their known characters should yet have shielded
them.</p>

<p>The ministers of the Regent might, however,
have done better justice to themselves, and to their
opportunities, but for their contemptible master.
The difficulty of conciliating that man was immensely
enhanced by his disreputable domestic
circumstances, and the daily need of avoiding exposure,
by keeping watch<a name="FNanchor_1_67" id="FNanchor_1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_67" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> upon the <i>Examiners</i>
and the <i>Registers</i> of the day. Animadversions
upon the conduct of the Irreclaimable are pretty
generally wasted; and when the Irreclaimable is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
in sovereign power, discussion on his personal
demerits is apt to be mixed up, somehow or other,
with such meaner questions as the welfare of his
subjects, and the stability of the Throne. At this
stage, “I told you so” becomes sedition; and
the next thought is of sabres, and bayonets, and
dungeons.</p>

<p>So the Liverpool ministry had their hands full,
between this selfish prince and starving people.
Throughout the year 1816, there was a determined
outcry for Parliamentary Reform and reduction of
public expenditure. And being demanded as
<i>rights</i>, the end of granting these things was looked
upon as something too awful to contemplate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One leading difficulty with the Reformers was
as to the mode: Reformers of that day must
be divided into classes and sub-classes, when their
history comes to be written. There were avowed
Republicans at one end of the scale, and advocates
of a purified Constitution at the other. Their
common opponents, however, not only refused to
make distinction, but took hold of minor differences
and threw them in the Reformers’ teeth; thus discrediting
the entire principle.</p>

<p>For example: Mr. Watson, surgeon, is found to
have a number of prepared pike-heads in his house.
He is ready to employ force, if it comes to the
point. Mr. William Cobbett, editor, takes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
liberty of telling the nation that it will never be
itself again without a reform. He abhors violence
of any sort or kind. Yet both of these persons,
along with all those of intermediate shades of opinion,
are decried as subverters of the Constitution.</p>

<p>This trick had been kept up for twenty-five
years past. And now that “the most powerful
and effective public writer that ever appeared,” the
“closest political reasoner of his time” (as described
by cotemporaries), was the leading writer and reasoner
upon Reform in Parliament: the best thing
to do was to impute unworthy and wicked motives,
and to follow that up by an endeavour to curtail
his liberty.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the principal London newspapers
were full of <span class="smcap">Cobbett</span>, from the middle of November,
1816, until the opening of Parliament; the
<i>Courier</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_68" id="FNanchor_2_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_68" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the <i>Times</i>, and the <i>Morning Post</i>, making
it their special business to misrepresent him.<a name="FNanchor_3_69" id="FNanchor_3_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_69" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
And, as the popular ferment had reached a high
point, nothing could be easier. Henry Hunt was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
holding forth to eager multitudes, whose conduct
(partly by incitement of Government spies) led to
measures being taken for preserving the peace.
When the Regent went to open Parliament, a
stone was thrown, which broke the window of his
carriage. Then the Government tried a raid upon
the Hampden Clubs, by hauling up their leading
members before a Secret Committee. But, beyond
a few scatter-brained individuals who really hoped
there was going to be a revolution, there was
nothing to fear. As the <i>Times</i> (Feb. 5th) said,
“Of anything like plot or conspiracy, in the
general and national sense of those words, no
symptoms have yet appeared.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, because people were clamouring for Reform
and remission of public burdens, the Home Secretary
and his friends were frightened out of their
lives. And, because Mr. Cobbett was the leader
and guider, upon these topics, he was charged with
exciting the labourers and journeymen to “burnings,
and plunderings, and devastations, and shedding
of blood.” The law officers of the Crown
were forthwith instructed to examine the “blasphemous
and seditious” pamphlets of the day; but,
as Lord Sidmouth was “sorry to say,” they were
“unable to find out anything which they could
prosecute with any chance of success!”</p>

<p>The Fears gained the day, however; and, to the
dismay of the parliamentary opposition, headed
by Earl Grey and Sir Samuel Romilly; and under
a protest of the Lords, led by the Duke of Sussex,
the ministry succeeded in passing a Bill for the
Suspension of Habeas Corpus.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The astonishing success of the cheap edition of
the <i>Register</i> caused a change in Cobbett’s domestic
arrangements. The woods and the fields had to
be relinquished; and he came up to London, so as
to be in the thick of the fight. Accordingly, we
find Wm. Cobbett, jun., installed as publisher, at
8, Catherine Street, Strand. The <i>Register</i> is now
entered at Stationers’ Hall, on account of the
garbled editions that have been printed by others;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
yet the proprietor “gladly” gives permission to
reprint his writings “in any regular newspaper.”
A cheap edition of “Paper against Gold” is being
issued in weekly numbers; and preparations are
made for a new serial, under the title of “The
Parliamentary Register.”</p>

<p>With all this writing, and printing and publishing,
it must have been hot and exciting work in
London. As the day for opening parliament
approached, the houses of Burdett, and Cartwright,
and Cobbett became the daily resort of Reformers.
At this time, Burdett was getting cool over the
great question, and the principal labours fell upon
the hands of Mr. Cobbett and of Lord Cochrane;
the latter, by the way, having charge of a monster
petition. Besides this, there were two public appearances
in Hampshire: one, on the occasion of
a grand meeting upon Portsdown hill, and the
other at Winchester. One evidence of the state of
popular feeling upon the questions of Reform and
of the threatened invasions of the liberty of the
people, is shown in the presentation of six hundred
petitions to the Commons on the 5th of March alone.</p>

<p>And well might the nation be alarmed. As
soon as the preliminaries of the session had been
completed, the ministry introduced their Habeas
Corpus Suspension Bill, and passed also an Act for
preventing “seditious meetings and assemblies.”
The public voice was thus completely enthralled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
And, amid all the hubbub, it was known that the
leading object in view was to silence Mr. Cobbett.<a name="FNanchor_4_70" id="FNanchor_4_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_70" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>The Government might as well have taken up
the broom of Mrs. Partington, in order to dispose
of Mr. Cobbett. The only effect, upon him, was to
provide new and beautiful topics for his readers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will first explain clearly what the Habeas Corpus
Act is, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>“Suffer me to say a word or two about the Hawkers’
and Pedlars’ Act.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and so forth; with full exposition of all previous
futile attempts upon the progress of liberty and
intelligence. The papers in the <i>Register</i> of this
period ought to have convinced Ministers of the
error of their ways: of the utterly false position in
which they had placed themselves. So clear in
description; so cogent in their reasoning; so
temperate. And withal, so full of the writer’s
own humour:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“… irreligious, immoral, or seditious <span class="smcap">Tendency</span>.
Only think of the extent of this word <i>tendency!</i> only think
of the boundless extent of such a word, and of such a
word being left to the interpretation of thousands of men!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Suppose the editor of a newspaper to insert an article,
which article recommended the reduction of the salt-tax:
what does this <i>tend</i> to? Why, to be sure, a magistrate
might think, to make the people discontented with the
salt-tax; to make them discontented with the salt-tax
would be, he might think, to make them discontented
with those who compel the people to pay it; those who
compel the people to pay it are Kings, Lords, and
Commons; and, therefore, here is an article which <i>tends</i>
to make the people discontented with Kings, Lords, and
Commons, and which, of course, <i>tends</i> to produce hatred
of them, and to bring about insurrection, treason, revolution,
and blood and carnage!”</p>

</div>

<p>Clear, and temperate, and lively as they were,
however, there was no mincing of matters; even
to the pointing out to Lord Sidmouth, at last, that
he was the real revolutionist,<a name="FNanchor_5_71" id="FNanchor_5_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_71" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and that all his
efforts were “unavailing as to the work of stifling.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Nothing will, can, or shall keep my writings
from the eyes of my suffering and faithful
countrymen!</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>But, if this was resolution and not mere swagger,
how was it to be done? Any one of his neighbours,
maliciously disposed, could have Mr. Cobbett
brought before a magistrate, and thrown into
jail without warning, for any word with a tendency.
What is more, they meant to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>There was only one way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A few years ago, being at Barnet Fair, I saw a battle
going on, arising out of some sudden quarrel, between a
butcher and the servant of a West-country grazier. The
butcher, though vastly superior in point of size, finding
that he was getting the worst of it, recoiled a step or two,
and drew out his knife. Upon the sight of this weapon,
the grazier turned about and ran off, till he came up to a
Scotchman who was guarding his herd, and out of whose
hand the former snatched a good ash-stick, about four
feet long. Having thus got what he called <i>a long arm</i>,
he returned to the combat, and, in a very short time, he
gave the butcher a blow upon the wrist, which brought
his knife to the ground. The grazier then fell to work
with his stick in such a style as I never before witnessed.
The butcher fell down, and rolled and kicked; but he
seemed only to change his position in order to insure to
every part of his carcase a due share of the penalty
of his baseness. After the grazier had, apparently,
tired himself, he was coming away, when, happening to
cast his eye upon the <i>knife</i>, he ran back and renewed the
basting, exclaiming every now and then, as he caught
his breath: ‘<i>Dra’ thy knife, wo’t?</i>’ He came away a
second time, and a second time returned, and set on
upon the caitiff again; and this he repeated several
times, exclaiming always when he recommenced the
drubbing: ‘Dra’ thy knife, wo’t?’&mdash;till, at last, the
butcher was so bruised, that he was actually unable to
stand or even to get up; and yet, such, amongst Englishmen,
is the abhorrence of foul fighting, that not a soul
attempted to interfere, and nobody seemed to pity a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
thus unmercifully beaten.</p>

<p>“It is my intention to imitate the conduct of
this grazier; to resort to <i>a long arm</i>, and to combat
Corruption, while I keep myself out of the reach of
her <i>knife</i>. Nobody called the grazier a coward, because
he did not stay to oppose his fists to a pointed and
cutting instrument. My choice, as I said before (leaving
all considerations of personal safety out of the question),
lies between silence and retreat. If I remain <i>here</i>, all
other means will be first used to reduce me to silence;
and if all these means fail, then will come the dungeon.
Therefore, that I may still be able to write, and
to write with freedom too, I shall write, if I live, from
<span class="smcap">America</span>.…”</p>

</div>

<p>This resolve appears to have been in Mr. Cobbett’s
mind since the middle of February, shortly
after the introduction of the Gagging Bills, as they
were called. It was now the end of March, and
the campaign against the popular press was in
victorious advance. People could almost hear the
prison doors creaking open. When, lo! the persecutors
wake up one morning, and find that the
wretch has flown!</p>

<p>Have you ever watched, reader, the gyrations of
pussy’s face&mdash;the involuntary muscular contortions
of her jaws, at sight of a dickey-bird, when that
gentle creature is on the wrong (but safe) side of
a window-pane? Such was the aspect of Authority,
when she found that Mr. Cobbett had slipped
through her fingers. And such, the impotent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
anger of his rivals.<a name="FNanchor_6_72" id="FNanchor_6_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_72" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The explosion of wrath, which
took place upon the discovery that he was out of
harm’s way, really appears laughable, to look back
upon it from this distance of time. He had eloped
from his creditors, had been diddling the Stamp
Office, had escaped imprisonment for life: he had
deserted his family, deserted the cause, deserted
his country: and, as for his pretended patriotism,
what did his friends think of the brave Cobbett now?
Even the Reformists, themselves, felt a shudder
of dismay pass over them; whilst the <i>Examiner</i>
class of scribblers fell upon the caitiff with their
envious sneers, retailing the lies and imputations
invented and cast about by their own enemies!
But, perhaps the unkindest cut of all was on the
part of the <i>Chronicle</i>, when that great bulwark
of whiggism, and mock-Reformist, informed its
readers that Cobbett had gone off to America
because the circulation of the <i>Register</i> had fallen
so low, through the operations of Sidmouth’s
acts.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter being that, in spite of all
that could be said, Mr. Cobbett’s flight to America
in 1817, was one of the cleverest and most spirite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>d
acts of his life. The decision of character, the
singleness of purpose, and confidence in his own
resources, displayed on this occasion, are almost
unexampled. Hundreds of writers had expatriated
themselves, before now; but where was the man
to be found, who had done so with a view to a
better fighting-ground? Political refugees were
swarming throughout the Union, but they were
beginning life anew; and who amongst them but
had cast the dust of their native country from off
their shoes&mdash;who but this one proclaimed, “England
is my country, and to England I shall
return,”&mdash;and lived to return and see his work
accomplished?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The world, then, was looking for its weekly
oracle (or weekly trash, or weekly venom, according
to the point of view), upon Saturday, the 5th of
April, 1817. Rumours had been afloat for several
days that Cobbett was in Liverpool, on his way to
America; and, upon the world going, with its
twopences, to Catherine Street, Strand, rumour
developed into certainty. The intending purchaser
of a <i>Register</i> received instead,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Cobbett’s Taking Leave of his
Countrymen.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> one more specimen of what Cobbett could
say, when his heart was more than usually full of
tender and earnest feeling, the reader will like to
have presented here some portions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My Beloved Countrymen,&mdash;Soon after this reaches
your eyes, those of the writer will, possibly, have taken
the last glimpse of the land that gave him birth, the land
in which his parents lie buried, the land of which he has
always been so proud; the land in which he leaves a
people whom he shall, to his last breath, love and esteem
beyond all the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>“Every one, if he can do it without wrong to another,
has a right to pursue the path to his own happiness; as
my happiness, however, has long been inseparable from
the hope of assisting in restoring the rights and liberties
of my country, nothing could have induced me to quit
that country, while there remained the smallest chance
of my being able, by remaining, to continue to aid her
cause. No such chance is now left. The laws which
have just been passed, especially if we take into view the
real objects of those laws, forbid us to entertain the idea,
that it would be possible to write on political subjects
according to the dictates of truth and reason, without
drawing down upon our heads certain and swift destruction.
It was well observed by Mr. Brougham, in a late
debate, that every writer who opposes the present measures,
‘must now feel that he sits down to write with a
halter about his neck,’ an observation the justice of which
must be obvious to all the world.</p>

<p>“Leaving, therefore, all considerations of personal
interest, personal feeling, and personal safety; leaving
even the peace of mind of a numerous and most affectionate
family wholly out of view, I have reasoned thus
with myself: What is now left to be done? We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
urged our claims with so much truth; we have established
them so clearly on the ground of both law and
reason, that there is no answer to us to be found other
than that of a suspension of our personal safety. If I
still write in support of those claims, I must be blind not
to see that a dungeon is my doom. If I write at all, and
do not write in support of those claims, I not only degrade
myself, but I do a great injury to the rights of the nation
by appearing to abandon them. If I remain here, I
must, therefore, <i>cease to write</i>, either from compulsion, or
from a sense of duty to my countrymen; therefore it is
impossible to do any good to the cause of my country by
remaining in it; but, if I remove to a country where I
can write with perfect freedom, it is not only <i>possible</i>, but
very <i>probable</i>, that I shall, sooner or later, be able to
render that cause important and lasting services.</p>

<p>“Upon this conclusion it is, that I have made my
determination; for, though life would be scarcely worth
preserving, with the consciousness that I walked about my
fields or slept in my bed merely at the mercy of a Secretary
of State; though, under such circumstances, neither
the song of the birds in spring, nor the well-strawed
homestead in winter could make me forget that I and my
rising family were slaves, still there is something so powerful
in the thought of country and neighbourhood, and
home and friends, there is something so strong in the
numerous and united ties with which these and endless
other objects fasten the mind to a long-inhabited spot,
that to tear oneself away nearly approaches to the separating
the soul from the body. But then, on the other
hand, I asked myself: ‘What! shall I submit in silence?
Shall I be as dumb as one of my horses? Shall that
indignation which burns within me be quenched? Shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
I make no effort to preserve even the <i>chance</i> of assisting
to better the lot of my unhappy country? Shall that
mind, which has communicated its light and warmth to
millions of other minds, now be extinguished for ever;
and shall those who, with thousands of pens at their command,
still saw the tide of opinion rolling more and more
heavily against them, now be ever secure from that pen,
by the efforts of which they feared being overwhelmed?
Shall truth never again be uttered? Shall her voice
never be heard, even from a distant shore?’</p>

<p>“Thus was the balance turned; and, my countrymen,
be you well assured that, though I shall, if I live, be at a
distance from you; though the ocean will roll between
us, not all the barriers that nature as well as art can raise,
shall be sufficient to prevent you from reading some part,
at least, of what I write; and, notwithstanding all the
wrongs of which I justly complain; notwithstanding all
the indignation that I feel; notwithstanding all the provocations
that I have received, or that I may receive,
never shall there drop from my pen anything which,
according to the law of the land, I might not safely write
and publish in England. Those who have felt themselves
supported by power, have practised towards me
foul play without measure; but though I shall have the
means of retaliation in my hands, never will I follow their
base example.</p>

<p>“Though I quit my country, far be it from me to look
upon her cause as desperate, and still farther be it from
me to wish to infuse despondency into your minds. <i>I can
serve that cause no longer by remaining here</i>; but the cause
itself is so good, so just, so manifestly right and virtuous,
and it has been combated by means so unusual, so unnatural,
and so violent, that it <i>must triumph</i> in the end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Besides, the circumstances of the country all tend to favour
the cause of Reform. Not a tenth part of the evils of
the system are yet in existence. The country gentlemen
who have now been amongst our most decided adversaries,
will very soon be compelled, for their own preservation,
to become our friends and fellow-labourers. Not
a fragment of their property will be left, if they do not
speedily bestir themselves. They have been induced to
believe that a Reform of the Parliament would expose
them to plunder or degradation; but they will very soon
find, that it will afford them the only chance of escaping
both. The wonder is that they do not see this already,
or rather that they have not seen it for years past.
But they have been blinded by their foolish pride; that
pride, which has nothing of mind belonging to it, and
which, accompanied with a consciousness of a want
of any natural superiority over the labouring classes,
seeks to indulge itself in a species of vindictive exercise
of power. There has come into the heads of these
people, I cannot very well tell how, a notion that it
is proper to consider the labouring classes as a distinct
<i>caste</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The writings of Malthus, who considers men as mere
animals, may have had influence in the producing of this
change; and we now frequently hear the working classes
called <i>the population</i>, just as we call the animals upon a
farm <i>the stock</i>. It is curious, too, that this contumely
towards the great mass of the people should have grown
into vogue amongst the country gentlemen and their
families, at a time when they themselves are daily and
hourly losing the estates descended to them from their
forefathers. They see themselves stripped of the means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> of
keeping that hospitality, for which England was once so
famed, and of which there remains nothing now but the
<i>word</i> in the dictionary: they see themselves reduced to
close up their windows, live in a corner of their houses,
sneak away to London, crib their servants in their wages, and
hardly able to keep up a little tawdry show; and it would
seem, that for the contempt which they feel that their
meanness must necessarily excite in the common people,
they endeavour to avenge themselves, and at the same time
to disguise their own humiliation, by their haughty and
insolent deportment towards the latter: thus exhibiting
that mixture of poverty and pride, which has ever been
deemed better calculated than any other union of qualities
to draw down upon the possessors the most unfriendly of
human feelings.</p>

<p>“It is curious, also, that this fit of novel and
ridiculous pride should have afflicted the minds of these
persons at the very time that the working classes are
become singularly enlightened. Not enlightened in the
manner that the sons of Cant and Corruption would
wish them to be. The conceited creatures in what is
called high life, and who always judge of men by their
clothes, imagine that the working classes of the people
have their minds quite sufficiently occupied by the reading
of what are called ‘religious and moral tracts.’ Simple,
insipid dialogues and stories, calculated for the minds
of children seven or eight years old, or for those of
savages just beginning to be civilized. These conceited
persons have no idea that the minds of the working
classes ever presume to rise above their infantine level.…
The working classes of the people understand well
what they read; they dive into all matters connected
with politics; they have a relish not only for in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>teresting
statement, for argument, for discussion; but the powers
of <i>eloquence</i> are by no means lost upon them.… In the
report of the Secret Committee of the House of Lords, it
is observed that, since the people have betaken themselves
to this reading and this discussing, ‘their character
seems to be wholly changed.’ I believe it is indeed!
For it is the natural effect of enlightening the mind to
change the character. But is not this change for the
better? If it be not, why have we heard so much about
the efforts for instructing the children of the poor?…
Has it been intended that these people, when taught to
read, should read nothing but Hannah More’s <i>Sinful
Sally</i>, and Mrs. Trimmer’s Dialogues? Faith! The
working classes of the people have a relish for no such
trash. They are not to be amused by a recital of the
manifold blessings of a state of things, in which
they have not half enough to eat, nor half enough to
cover their nakedness by day, and to keep them from
perishing by night. They are not to be amused by the
pretty stories about ‘the bounty of providence in making
brambles for the purpose of tearing off pieces of the
sheep’s wool, in order that the little birds may come and
get it to line their nests with to keep their young ones
warm!’ Stories like these are not sufficient to fill the
minds of the working classes of the people. They want
something more solid. They have had something more
solid. Their minds, like a sheet of paper, have received
the lasting impressions of undeniable fact and unanswerable
argument; and it will always be a source of the
greatest satisfaction to me to reflect that I have been mainly
instrumental in giving those impressions, which I am
very certain will never be effaced from the minds of the
people of this country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“I shall be as careful as I have been, not to write anything
that even a special jury would pronounce to be a
<i>Libel</i>. I have no desire to write libels. I have written
none here. Lord Sidmouth was ‘sorry to say’ that I
had not written anything that the law officers could prosecute
with any chance of success. I do not remove for
the purpose of writing libels, but for the purpose of being
able to write what is <i>not</i> libellous. I do not retire from
a combat with the Attorney-General, but from a combat
with a dungeon, deprived of pen, ink, and paper. A
combat with the Attorney-General is quite unequal
enough. That, however, I would have encountered. I
know too well what a trial by Special Jury is. Yet that,
or any sort of <i>trial</i>, I would have stayed to face. So
that I could have been sure of a trial, of whatever sort, I
would have run the risk. But, against the absolute
power of imprisonment, without even a hearing, for time
unlimited, in any jail in the kingdom, without the use of
pen, ink, and paper, and without any communication
with any soul but the keepers; against such a power it
would have been worse than madness to attempt to
strive. Indeed, there could be no striving, in such a
case; where I should have been as much at the disposal
of the Secretary of State as are the shoes which he has
upon his feet. No! I will go, where I shall not be as
the shoes upon Lord Sidmouth’s and Lord Castlereagh’s
feet. I will go where I can make sure of the use of pen,
ink, and paper; and these two lords may be equally sure
that, in spite of everything they can do, unless they openly
enact or proclaim a censorship on the press, or cut off all
commercial connexion with America, you, my good and
faithful countrymen, shall be able to read what I write.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“And now, my countrymen, before I set off, let me
caution you against giving the smallest credit to anything
that Corruption’s Press may assert of me. You have
seen what atrocious falsehoods it has put forth in my
presence; what, then, will it not do in my absence? I
have written thousands of letters to various persons in
all parts of the kingdom. I give any one leave to make
public any letter of mine, accompanied by the certificate
of any respectable friend of mine, that it is in my handwriting.
I challenge all those, whom I ever conversed
with, to say, that I ever uttered a wish to see overthrown
any one of the Constitutional establishments of the kingdom;
and, I most solemnly declare that I never associated
with any man who professed, even in private, to
entertain any such wish; but, on the contrary, all those
with whom I have ever been intimate in politics, have
always had in view the preservation of all the establishments
and orders of the kingdom, as one of the objects
of a timely reform of the Parliament.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“A mutual affection, a powerful impulse, equal to
that out of which this wonderful sagacity arises, will, I
hope, always exist between me and my hard-used countrymen;
an affection which my heart assures me, no
time, no distance, no new connexions, no new association
of ideas however enchanting, can ever destroy, or in
any degree enfeeble or impair.… Never will I own as
my friend him who is not a friend of the people of England.
I will never become a Subject or a Citizen in any
other State, and will always be a foreigner in every country
but England. Any foible that may belong to your
character, I shall always willingly allow to belong to my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
own. All the celebrity which my writings have obtained,
and which they will preserve long and long after Lords
Liverpool, and Sidmouth, and Castlereagh are rotten and
forgotten, I owe less to my own talents than to that discernment,
and that noble spirit in you, which have at
once instructed my mind and warmed my heart: and,
my beloved countrymen, be you well assured that the
last beatings of that heart will be, love for the people,
for the happiness, and the renown of England; and
hatred of their corrupt, hypocritical, dastardly, and
merciless foes.”</p>

that&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Wm. Cobbett.</span></p>

<p>“<i>Liverpool, 28th March, 1817.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p>Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>e suspension of the <i>Register</i> lasted for about
three months. On the 12th of July it was resumed,
with a letter dated from Cobbett’s residence,
May 8th, and the journal was kept up without
further interruption. Only on one or two occasions
did a number appear in which there was not
a communication from the exiled editor.</p>

<p>But his place in the journalistic world was not
left utterly vacant. William Hone led the way,
with his <i>Reformists’ Register</i>, among a series of
similar publications.<a name="FNanchor_7_73" id="FNanchor_7_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_73" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Indeed, it was understood
that Hone’s Register occupied the position which
Mr. Cobbett had temporarily abdicated. Hone
had been a staunch supporter, since the <i>Political
Register</i> had become popularized; besides making
a depôt for that journal at his little shop in the
Old Bailey, he had recently reproduced the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
autobiography of Peter Porcupine in a cheap
form.<a name="FNanchor_8_74" id="FNanchor_8_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_74" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In the course of the summer of this year, an
exposure of the spy system was made in the House
of Commons; and it was proved, over and over
again, that nearly all the serious riots had been
instigated by these wretches, actually in the employ
of Government. The result was a public
condemnation of the infamous system, and its
immediate disuse on the part of ministers. And,
as a matter of course, all the signs of turbulence
in the country ceased; the Habeas Corpus Suspension
Act being repealed soon after the next
meeting of Parliament. In fact, every day proved,
more and more clearly, that it was nothing but
fear which had magnified a few local discontents&mdash;by
means of that powerful lens, Anti-Reform&mdash;into
designs upon the fabric of the Constitution.</p>

<p>But the mischief done to the temper of the
people was irreparable. Those persons (of whom
there must be some proportion, even among such
a phlegmatic race as the English) whose reforming
zeal was easily raised to fever heat, got into
trouble; and several suffered the capital penalty
for treason, during the years 1817-19. Their i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>mprudence,
however, could not delay, for long, the
imminent Reform; the violence done to popular
feeling, by a combination of cruelty and weakness,
was bearing its fruit; and this is how, in spite of
its natural claims upon the patriotism of Englishmen,
Toryism came to bear undeserved opprobrium.
We, who are of no party but that of Progress and
Enlightenment, and who have long ceased to
believe in traditional politics, whether Whig or
Tory, will not fail to take to heart again the
lesson: that violence, impatience, and selfish prescription
are as much out of place in the political
as in the moral world. We have had ample opportunities
of noting this, during the last half-century;
and if there is anything upon which we may congratulate
ourselves, it is that we have had Melbournes
and Peels, Russells and Palmerstons,
during a period of European revolution, instead of
such men as the favourites of George the Third.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">“WHATEVER OTHER FAULTS I MAY HAVE, THAT
OF LETTING GO MY HOLD IS NOT ONE.”</span></h2>

<p>Among the topics which, of recent years, had been
current matter for discussion, our relations with
the United States were not the least important.
The dispute, arising from repeated violations of
neutrality on the part of England, which ultimately
led to the war of 1812, was the fruit of purely
administrative errors; and had nothing to do with
the popular sentiment of this country. The two
nations had become reconciled, for fifteen years
past; and, had it not been for the arbitrary
assumptions put forth by the British Government,
on the basis of our alleged naval supremacy, every
aspect gave promise of close international friendship.</p>

<p>It may be said, however, that the contest had its
beneficial side. The peace, which ensued, has
never since been broken: quite as much, perhaps,
because conciliation has since become the ruling
idea in English foreign politics, as on account of
any fanciful beliefs in the abstract inutility o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>f war.
The last lingering traditions, as to the possibility
of the Yankees being coerced, were banished from
the minds of English statesmen by the events of
this naval war; and, such point gained, the fogs of
many minor prejudices naturally disappeared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of those persons who, with pen in hand, aided in
the solution of the questions in dispute with, and
in the enlightenment of the people concerning, the
United States of America, there is none whose
services can be compared with those of the subject
of these pages. Whilst the London press was
encouraging the Government, besides misleading
the people as to the real nature and prospects of
the conflict, Mr. Cobbett was declaring, as he had
been declaring from the first: that the points in
dispute would have to be given up, or the war
would last for years. Mr. Cobbett’s patriotism,
and Mr. Cobbett’s decency were, as usual, called
in question; but the “points” were unreservedly
relinquished, and Mr. Cobbett was right, once
more.</p>

<p>So, it came to pass that another reconciliation
ensued besides that between the two peoples. The
Republicans of New York and Philadelphia discovered
that Peter Porcupine was not such a vile
wretch after all. They read his <i>Register</i>, and
reprinted portions of it.<a name="FNanchor_1_75" id="FNanchor_1_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_75" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> They sent him newspapers.
And one effusive committee, of Albany, New York,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
sent him a suit of clothes (“made of cloth manufactured
in this State, from wool grown within it.”)<a name="FNanchor_2_76" id="FNanchor_2_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_76" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>There followed, of course, effusiveness on the
part of Mr. Cobbett. Theirs was a free country,
where the truth might be spoken and written,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
without fear of an Attorney-general; there were
still many political evils rampant there, but the
mass of the people were enlightened; they would
produce their own wool, in spite of the Yorkshire
clothiers; they would soon have a fleet, have
manufactures, take the lead in agriculture, and set
an example to the world of civil and religious
liberty. And, he expressed his great pleasure, nay
pride, that his weekly essays were thought worthy
of being moulded into pamphlets and books, for
the use of the free American nation.</p>

<p>All this led, at last, to closer intercourse, and,
upon repeated difficulties occurring with the Post
Office, Mr. Cobbett resolved to attempt an American
edition of the <i>Political Register</i>, with the twofold
object of cementing these pleasant relations,
and of allowing a little more freedom in the handling
of certain delicate matters. Accordingly, an
office was opened in New York, early in 1816,
(under the care of one Oldfield, and a nephew,
Henry Cobbett), for the purposes of this republication.
This was not, however, an affair of long
continuance; its failure being partly due to post-office
vigilance, by means of which a good deal of
the MS. despatched to America found its way into
the office of Lord Castlereagh.</p>

<p>It will be understood, then, that there were
plenty of inducements for a short visit to the
United States. And, upon landing at New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>,
early in May, 1817, Mr. Cobbett found that he had
rightly judged the temper of the Americans; for
he was immediately surrounded with new friends;
while old ones from Pennsylvania turned up from
time to time.</p>

<p>His first step, the day after his arrival, was to
cross into Long Island and look about for a farm:
an object of no very great difficulty. The next
was to begin writing to his “beloved countrymen.”
And the next may be guessed from the fact, that,
on the day that his countrymen once more read
the <i>Register</i> in the middle of July, a crop of peas
was gathered which he had himself sown.</p>

<p>The farm in Long Island soon became the house
of call for emigrants from England. Farmers who
had “escaped from the tax-gatherer,” and had
brought out the remnant of their fortunes; journeymen
and labourers, “escaping from tyranny;”
countrymen, fleeing from ruin and starvation&mdash;even
tradesmen, in despair, were flocking over; besides
numbers of people who, from their previous training
or occupations, were unfit for emigration. And the
people of England, in consequence, knew more
about life in America than they ever knew before.<a name="FNanchor_3_77" id="FNanchor_3_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_77" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Intermingled with the usual comments and warnings
on current politics, Mr. Cobbett gave his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
readers minute and graphic details of his mode of
life, and of the happiness and comfort ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>ound him:
with no taxes, tithes, nor game-laws; no excisemen,
spies, nor packed juries; no Castlereaghs, Eldons,
Ellenboroughs, nor Sidmouths; labourers with
plenty to eat and drink;&mdash;a fine climate, good
neighbours, and a wide-spreading scene of general
comfort and well-being; for everybody who came
out resolved to work with honesty and spirit.</p>

<p>Of course, all these glowing accounts would
sometimes bring out the wrong sort of men. Not
only the lazy, who had estimated the prospects of
emigration without including the important factor
of hard work: but agents, and land-jobbers, and
superficial gallopers through the country; many of
these were induced to come, and went home again
to tell of their disgust, at not finding the riche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>s of
the country flow into their open mouths.<a name="FNanchor_4_78" id="FNanchor_4_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_78" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Upon the whole, Mr. Cobbett must be considered
to have greatly benefited his fellow-countrymen by
his short settlement in Long Island; not only by
truthful and painstaking accounts of the modes of
life, and the resources of the country, but by his
oft-repeated inculcation of industry, perseverance,
and the moral virtues. But this is not all. This
period saw the commencement of what is, in some
respects, the most useful part of Mr. Cobbett’s
career; that part, namely, during which he serv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>ed
the cause of sound popular education.</p>

<p>His purpose, to this end, is first announced in
a letter to Mr. Benbow, one of the recently imprisoned
printers under the “Gagging” Act:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I now proceed to develope my plan for assisting in
the acquirement of book-learning all those against whom
the Borough-mongers have, in a great degree, closed the
door to such learning, and whom they have the insolence
to denominate the ‘Lower Orders.’ To effect this object
it is my intention to publish, at a very cheap rate (though
the word <i>cheap</i> may shake the nerves of Sidmouth and
Canning to jelly)&mdash;at a very cheap rate it is my intention
to publish&mdash;First, ‘An English Grammar for the use of
apprentices, plough-boys, soldiers, and sailors.’ Second,
‘A History of the Laws and Constitution of England,’
for the use of the same description of persons. Third,
‘A History of the Church and of Religion in England, in
which will be seen the origin of the present <i>claims</i> of the
clergy, and in which their <i>duties</i> will also be shown,’ for
the use of the same description of persons. Fourth, ‘A
view of the present state of the Income, Debt, and Expenses
of the Kingdom; its Population and Paupers; its
causes of Embarrassment and Misery, and the means of
Restoration to ease and happiness,’ for the use of the
same description of persons.”</p>

</div>

<p>The plan was not carried out in its entirety;
although much of the material was furnished, in
one form or other, in the pages of the <i>Register</i>
during the ensuing years of its course. The idea,
at any rate, was pursued in the numerous essays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
on history and political economy presented to his
readers from time to time. As for the Grammar,
that was put in hand at once, and was published
in London in December, 1818.</p>

<p>The success of the “English Grammar” was
what might have been expected. Ten thousand
copies were sold in a few weeks; a third edition
being called for before the end of February. And
it holds its own to this day&mdash;not as a class-book,
for which it is unfit from its verbosity and its odd
mixture of politics and humour; but for the purpose
of self-education, for which it is of unrivalled
value.</p>

<p>The Grammar had been preceded, in London,
by “A Year’s Residence in America,” which purported
to give current information as to the condition
and prospects of the country, besides a
journal of his own proceedings. Mr. Cobbett’s
hands were, therefore, full of work as ever; and
his mind full as ever of thoughts concerning his
own country. He tells Major Cartwright (who
had written to inform Cobbett that he might safely
return home) that he has begun several works,
which, if he does not finish them now, he is sure he
never shall. A little later, he writes to Henry
Hunt, that he shall move the moment he thinks
that he can do more good that way than by
remaining; feeling quite certain as to the final issue
of the great cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>And he tells his readers that he has, in no sense,
abandoned England: that the farther he is distant
from England the stronger he always finds his
attachment toward her. A year’s absence had
cooled his resentment; while it had, if possible,
added to his feelings of affection toward his
countrymen. “All the good that he had left
behind was constantly in his thoughts, while the
bad gradually became less and less frequently
thought of.”</p>

<p>Not that, however, the warfare upon Corruption
was to cease. He was there “to uphold the honour
of England,” and to “aim deadly blows against
her tyrants.” And no better proof of the need of
his lash could be found, than is furnished by the
continued attacks upon his character.</p>

<p>But he had the ear of millions of people, who were
suffering, more or less undeservedly, from the
tyranny and misgovernment of irresponsible persons;
and what was it, that the supporters of the
Irresponsible classes continued their falsehoods and
malignity? So the <i>Register</i> pursued its wonderful
course, “skimming over the face of the Atlantic
like the dove, of the innocence of which it partook;”
and still finding its way into thousands of English
cottage homes.</p>

<p>The governing principle of Mr. Cobbett’s political
leanings was, still, his hatred of a paper-currency.
And, in the year 1819, upon hearing that Parliamen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>t
was preparing to authorize an early resumption
of cash payment on the part of the Bank
of England, he foresaw the inevitable panic and
distress which must further ensue, before the country
could again tread the path of prosperity. Hence,
he thought, the opportunity for the Parliamentary
Reformers: the certainty that the cause would be
nearer of attainment; and he at once prepared for
his return home. There was little to keep him in
Long Island, separated from the bulk of his family:
a farm was easily disposed of; and an accidental
fire upon the premises&mdash;which caused him to seek
shelter in a tent, “the walls of which were made
of <i>Morning Chronicles</i> and <i>Couriers</i>, pasted upon
laths that were a foot asunder,”&mdash;only gave occasion
for expediting his departure.</p>

<p>There was, however, another “duty” (as he
deemed it) to perform before leaving the soil of
America. That self-imposed task was one of the
most difficult, one of the most delicate, to which a
man might lend himself: the attempt to do honour
to a name which the world had chosen to scorn.
The severest test, which Mr. Cobbett had ever yet
applied to public opinion, was now to be outdone;
for the name in question was that of <span class="smcap">Thomas
Paine</span>.<a name="FNanchor_5_79" id="FNanchor_5_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_79" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Chalmers’s lif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>e of Paine, written in 1792, had
merits of its own, which suited the violent and
depraved taste of the times. It speedily ran
through many editions; and no one contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
more to its circulation than Peter Porcupine, who
reprinted it in his <i>Censor</i> of September, 1796,
“interspersed with remarks and reflections.” But
a neophyte writer, ardent in cotemporary loyalism,
reading and greedily sucking-in the venomous
plausibilities of Chalmers, is one thing: the same
person coming to read, in his days of maturity,
Paine’s eloquent pleadings against oppression and
misrule, is another; especially if maturity of
strength and wisdom has brought with it a full
admission of old weaknesses: renunciation of
ignorance and folly. So Mr. Cobbett found that
Thomas Paine was not such a blackguard: not so
deserving of the abuse which he had helped to pour
upon him; and proceeded, accordingly, to make
reparation, by extolling Paine’s merits as a writer
(whilst, however, condemning his theology), and
recommending the writings to his friends, whenever
opportunity served. That which had led him
to study Paine for himself was “The Decline and
Fall of the English System of Finance,” a pamphlet
in which Paine had distinctly foretold the bursting
of the paper-money bubble; and the reader will
understand Cobbett’s great enthusiasm, upon the
discovery that Paine’s elucidations furnished him
with a key to what he considered the leading peril
of the nation.</p>

<p>All this, howe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>ver, might have casually passed
into the catalogue of Mr. Cobbett’s “inconsistencies,”
without attracting special notice, but for the following
circumstances:&mdash;</p>

<p>Paine had wished to be buried in the Quaker
burial-ground of New York; but the request was
denied&mdash;the principal alleged reason being that
many persons had already accused the sect of
Deism, and that, if they allowed this interment,
the accusation would have a circumstance to rest
upon. Mr. Paine was, therefore, buried in the
corner of one of his own fields.</p>

<p>In September or October, 1819, the land having
been previously sold, with a reservation of that
particular spot, the person, whose business it was
to take care of that little corner, was so sensible of
the risk of disturbance to Paine’s ashes that he
commenced a negotiation for the purpose of having
them transferred to a New York churchyard. The
utmost that could be obtained was “leave to put
them in the ground in a refuse place, where
strangers and soldiers and other friendless persons
were usually buried.”</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, Mr. Cobbett (whose
farm lay only a few miles off from New Rochelle)
resolved that Paine’s bones should “really have
honourable burial!”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Paine lies in a little hole under the grass and weeds
of an obscure farm in America. There, however, he shall
not lie, unnoticed, much longer. He belongs to England.
His fame is the property of England; and if no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
other people will show that they value that fame, the
people of England will. Yes, amongst the pleasures that
I promise myself, is that of seeing the name of Paine
honoured in every part of England; where base corruption
caused him, while alive, to be burnt in effigy.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now this, be it observed in passing, was quite
in accord with Cobbett’s habitual notions as to the
reverent treatment of the dead; as any industrious
reader of him well knows.<a name="FNanchor_6_80" id="FNanchor_6_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_80" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>He now proceeded to keep the subject alive by
frequent references; and, at last, announced that
the coffin had been taken up, and would be sent off
to England in the same condition as it was found.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We will honour his name,” he says, “his remains
and his memory, in all sorts of ways. While the dead
Borough-mongers, and the base slaves who have been their
tools, moulder away under unnoticed masses of marble
and brass, the tomb of this ‘Noble of Nature’ will be an
object of pilgrimage with the people.… Let this be
considered the act of the Reformers of England, Scotland,
and Ireland. In their name we opened the grave,
and in their name will the tomb be raised. We do not
look upon ourselves as adopting <i>all</i> Pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>e’s opinions upon
all subjects. He was a great man, an Englishman, a
friend of freedom, and the first and greatest enemy of the
Borough and Paper System. This is enough for us.”</p>

</div>

<p>So, with this unusual piece of luggage in his
possession, Mr. Cobbett returned to England, reaching
Liverpool at the end of November, 1819, in
company with his son William.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The conspiracy panic had well-nigh died away.
But, in August, 1819, the memorable occurrence,
known as the Manchester massacre, was the means
of reanimating the fears of ministers, through the
spirit of indignation which it had roused throughout
the land. Parliament was called together in
November, for the purpose of fresh repressive
legislation; the product of which was the celebrated
series, known as the <i>Six Acts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7_81" id="FNanchor_7_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_81" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Mr. Cobbett met his
friends again at Liverpool: to the dismay of some,
who told him that he was “jumping into the lion’s
mouth:” to the joy of the great body of Reformers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
who hastened to testify their gratification
by every means in their power. From the towns
of Yorkshire and Lancashire, especially, the Reformers
crowded forward with addresses of welcome:
in spite of the revived opposition of
authority&mdash;opposition which was displayed in an
unusual manner; as, when a poor fellow was put
into jail, for going round the town of Bolton with
the crier’s bell, in order to announce Mr. Cobbett’s
safe return. Into jail, for ten weeks!<a name="FNanchor_8_82" id="FNanchor_8_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_82" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>There was no need for violence on either <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>side.
As for Mr. Cobbett, he was constantly urging that
“our cause” was “too good for any violence:” that
he would have nothing to do with Reformers who
called themselves Republicans. His first essays,
after his return, are models of temperateness and
wisdom: advice to the prime minister upon the
condition of the country, and advice to the Reformers
on sobriety and frugality: writings which
would have raised a new man to immediate fame
and fortune. But, they came from an old offender,
whose unasked advice had too long been a terror.
Violence, on the part of Mr. Cobbett’s opponents,
did not cease&mdash;and he had, unfortunately, by his
own imprudence, placed the means of violence in
their hands. In the first place, the incident of
Paine’s bones, coming at the time it did, was
enough to damn any man’s reputation for discretion
as to the fitness of things&mdash;nothing could
have been more inopportune. In America, it was
true, people were beginning to understand Paine,
and republish his works. But in England, he was
known only by his theology; and was branded as
an Atheist, by the hirelings who could not, or dare
not try to, refute him. No name on earth was
buried beneath such a weight of obloquy. So,
nothing could be easier, nothing so effective, as to
couple the two names. And any fool who chose
to call Mr. Cobbett an atheist, upon the word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
some “constitutional” pamphleteer, could do so.
As for the unfortunate bones, there never was such
a joke! An ephemeral literature actually sprung
up, on the topic<a name="FNanchor_9_83" id="FNanchor_9_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_83" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;whilst, from the custom house
officers at Liverpool, startled at the unexpected
importation,&mdash;to the man who now has them in
his possession: from the man who recorded the
arrival of the “bone-grubber,” to our very latest
historical sketcher: the affair has been a laughing-stock.</p>

<p>And it cannot be said that this derision is altogether
unmerited. Mr. Cobbett ought to have
known his countrymen well enough, to remember
that “relics” of this sort are thrown away upon
them. He should have known that such a freak
as his could only be safely performed, by an
organized and influential public movement; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>nd
then, only, with a certainty of having to face disagreeable
controversy. That the bones will be
wanted, some day, may be safely predicted; knowing
what we do of <span class="smcapuc">THE WHIRLIGIG OF TIME</span>. But
the business of raising a monument, recording
the wisdom and political virtues of Thomas Paine,
will scarcely be within the scope of that man’s
powers who “stands alone.”<a name="FNanchor_10_84" id="FNanchor_10_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_84" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Again, a subject which had greatly disturbed the
minds of Mr. Cobbett’s friends was his relation with
Sir Francis Burdett. The latter had advanced
money to Cobbett (or to Wright for him), and there
appeared little probability of its being repaid. Mr.
Cobbett had acknowledged the debt (with some
sort of protest, however), and promised to repay it,
after he was enabled to provide for his family
again.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Burdett had already inspired suspicion,
in the breasts of the Reformers, as not
being in earnest. He had called upon the people,
for several years past, to “rally” and to “come
forward,” and so on; but would back out of it at
a critical juncture. He was still “Westminster’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>s
pride and England’s glory,” in the hands of a
Westminster clique; but, when the troubles of
1816-1817 began, he seemed to shrink from the
cause of Reform. Perhaps he dreaded Republicanism,
or had some other good reason for his
backwardness. Certain it is, that, just before the
opening of parliament in 1817, when all the leaders
were wanted at their posts, Burdett was not there.
And, upon Lord Cochrane proposing an amendment
to the Address, which would have at least
produced debate, Sir Francis allowed the motion
to drop without a seconder. Now, this was so
much like all the Whig popularity-hunting; and
this end so much like the end of that,&mdash;that Cartwright
and all the hearty Reformers ceased to put
great faith in Burdett; and Mr. Cobbett only spoke
the feelings of all, when he indignantly pointed out
what was very like a betrayal of the cause. The
only explanation that appears to have been obtained
from Burdett was a protest against “being
used as a puppet.”</p>

<p>Among the newspaper anecdotes which synchronized
with Cobbett’s departure for America,
was one concerning the debt of 3000<i>l.</i> to Sir Francis.
This was the first the public heard of it. And,
upon Mr. Cobbett proceeding to castigate Burdett
for his lukewarmness, people called it “ingratitude”
and “inconsistency.” This, however, might
have been treated with contempt, but for the publica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>tion
of some correspondence in the <i>Examiner</i>,
which made it appear that Mr. Cobbett meant to
repudiate the debt; a construction which it was
quite possible to form, without knowing all the
circumstances, and by the easy process of reading
“extracts.”<a name="FNanchor_11_85" id="FNanchor_11_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_85" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>So, after Cobbett’s return from America, almost
till the last year of his life, his money-affairs with
Burdett were repeatedly cropping up, both in the
newspapers and in the <i>Political Register</i>. The
matter is not creditable to either of the parties.
And when, after Cobbett’s death, upon a proposal
to raise some kind of memorial, Sir Francis sent
the 3000<i>l.</i> bond to the committee, telling them that
they could take his subscription out of that; it
looked a very unworthy proceeding on the part of
a man, who had really owed a vast deal of his
popularity and distinction to Mr. Cobbett’s zealous
advocacy. Burdett’s vanity was at least equal to
Cobbett’s egotism; and neither could forgive the
other, after their special weaknesses had been
shown up at each other’s hands. Several endeavours
at reconciliation were made, on the part
of mutual friends, but they ended in nothing.</p>

<p>Another episode, of this period, gave still m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>ore
trouble to Mr. Cobbett. There was an influential
batch of politicians in Westminster, of which
Francis Place was one of the leaders. Their liberalism
went in the line of electoral purity, and verged
toward Republicanism; and their favourites were
Burdett and Hobhouse. At the election of June,
1818, Henry Hunt stood as a candidate, and this
clique (known as the Rump Committee) opposed
him with all their might. The secretary and agent
was one Thomas Cleary, who had given much aid
as promoter of Hampden clubs throughout the
country, and was studying as a barrister. Mr.
John Wright was connected with this set; and,
being in possession of several hundred of Cobbett’s
old letters,<a name="FNanchor_12_86" id="FNanchor_12_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_86" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> found one among them which reflected
strongly upon Hunt’s private character. We have
already perused it, as the reader will recollect.<a name="FNanchor_13_87" id="FNanchor_13_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_87" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Wright showed this to Francis Place, and Place
showed it to Cleary, who read it out to the electors,
on the first opportunity: adding, “In the language
of Mr. Cobbett, I have only to say, ‘He’s a sad
fellow, beware of him.’” So electoral purity draws
the line at some point or other: in this case, at the
point outside of which lies a detestable breach of
confidence.</p>

<p>The consequ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>ences may be imagined. Mr. Cobbett
first heard of it through the medium of a
New York paper, and lost his temper over it.
Both Cobbett and Burdett had associated with
Mr. Hunt, of late years: had gone sporting with
him, and had even been under the same roof with
“the lady.” This was stronger in Mr. Cobbett’s
recollection than the memory of his first scanty
acquaintance with Hunt; and a hasty note, written
more than ten years ago, had entirely faded from
his memory. So he, in his first outburst of anger,
charged Cleary with forging the letter; and, afterward,
on several occasions, represented Wright as
a rogue, “unparalleled in the annals of infamy;”
giving his readers a graphic story of how the latter
had falsified accounts; and how his little son had
been a witness (in Newgate) of the “big drops of
sweat standing upon the caitiff’s brow,” upon the
occasion of his detection.</p>

<p>Now, this was quite indefensible. And the
only excuse that can be made is that Mr. Cobbett
had been gradually losing his habitual coolness
and calmness in the face of calumny. Instead of
his old habit of treating it with contempt, he had
begun the practice of answering misrepresentation:
the very thing that your scandal-monger likes.
And, in this case, three thousand miles away, with
at least three months’ interval between a calumny
and the possibility of a retort; and with a growing
habit of nursing political and personal grievances:
it is no wonder that he flew into a passion; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
in the end, so exposed Mr. Cleary that many of
the latter’s friends refused to have any more dealings
with him, or even to hold discourse with him.
So, upon Cobbett’s return to England, Cleary
challenged him to fight; of course to no purpose.
He then brought an action, laying the damages at
two thousand pounds. The jury showed what
they thought of the matter, by awarding him forty
shillings.<a name="FNanchor_14_88" id="FNanchor_14_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_88" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>A few days afterward, the case of <i>Wright</i> v.
<i>Cobbett</i> was heard.</p>

<p>This was a more serious affair. The imputations
against Wright were quite needless, even if they
could be justified. And the defendant, at the
last moment, withdrew his plea of justification from
the record, and based his defence upon the fact
that his son (and not himself) was the present proprietor
of the <i>Register</i>: that his sons were in the
habit of altering his manuscript at their discretion.
These technical pretences, so commonly resorted
to, might have answered very well in the hands of
a practised lawyer; but, with the “defendant in
person,” it was like a child playing with edged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
tools. And against Scarlett, too, one of the
cleverest counsel of the day; a man who hated the
Reform set; and who had, in the House of Commons,
alluded to Cobbett as a “contemptible scribbler,”
and, on the present occasion, could go out of his
way to say how much he approved of Cobbett’s
early estimate of Paine, and his former writings
generally. He maintained that the letter which
Cleary read, and which had caused all the trouble,
was one intended for publication, although the
judge (at the former trial) had very strongly reprobated
Cleary’s conduct. Whilst he, of course,
enjoyed a complete triumph over the withdrawal
of the plea of justification, and the clumsy efforts
of the defendant to make his sons responsible.</p>

<p>The folly and conceit of appearing “in person”
was never more signally exemplified; especially as
Mr. Cobbett had, just then, his hands full over the
poor Queen,<a name="FNanchor_15_89" id="FNanchor_15_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_89" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and over his own chaotic pecuniary
affairs; and it was sufficiently punished by the
result. The jury deliberated for nearly two hours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and brought in a verdict of 1000<i>l.</i> damages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>These things were “much against him,” as Lord
Brougham would say. The press got into the
way of saying that Cobbett had lost all character,
and all respect, and so on. New pamphlets came
out: the patriot was really down, this time; and
his fate squared so neatly with all that had been
predicted of him, and of every subverter of the
constitution.</p>

<p>But, there are reputations, and reputations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Pygmies are pygmies still, though perch’d on alps,</div>
<div class="verse">And pyramids are pyramids in vales!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And, whilst a good name is not to be thought
lightly of, it is not every one’s esteem that can be
considered man’s best and highest reward. The
hollow, specious, moral judgments of mankind,
when under the dominion of prejudice, are not the
standards by which to judge the men of life and
earnestness: the men whose convictions, and not
whose personal interests, mark their path. And, in
the case in point: the moral judgment of all the
toad-eaters and the place-hunters of the day could
hardly be a desirable standard, wherewith to gau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>ge
the character of a man whose faults lay just upon
the surface; whose faults could, by no possible
twist or distortion of idea, be shown to proceed
from bad impulses.<a name="FNanchor_16_90" id="FNanchor_16_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_90" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>What “interests” Mr. C<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>obbett had, were now
unmistakably identified with those of the labouring
classes of England; and, at last, he had got a good
hearing from those classes. The distinction of
classes, wantonly and unnecessarily proclaimed for
twenty years past, was now confirmed; and the ten
years of George the Fourth’s reign mark the period
of conflict which was partly the result of this forced
distinction. The end of this conflict, and the ultimate
triumph of the popular cause, is matter of
history: the bloodless reformation of 1832 has
saved the British Constitution, instead of destroying
it. That triumph of principles was the work of
neither Whig nor Tory. It came from the provoked
and suffering people themselves. The
greater the provocation, the deeper the suffering,&mdash;the
more certain was to be the end: and from
them, alone, it came. And, as more light is thrown,
from time to time, upon these stirring days, the
better can we see who were the real leaders and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
guiders in Reform; and who was the greatest of
them all. For, until this <span class="smcap">Samson</span> arose, the
progress of the cause had been little better than
a series of ridiculous evasions and desertions.</p>

1813.) The editor is a Federalist, and thinks it surprising that
Cobbett should have described so accurately seventeen years ago the
<i>present</i> condition of the States.

“Letters on the Late War between the United States and Great
Britain, &amp;c., &amp;c., by William Cobbett, Esq.” (New York, 1815).
The preface is highly eulogistic, and forgives all Cobbett’s former
wickedness.

Unqueen’d by the American Cock-boats, &amp;c., &amp;c. Illustrated and

Cobbett, Esq.” (Philadelphia, 1815). This editor is also very
magnanimous.
</p>
<p>
It was a marked characteristic of the estimates formed by Cobbett’s
cotemporaries that the party, or the set, which he for the time
being appeared to support, readily overlooked his former opinions
and so-called “inconsistencies.” This applies to London, as well
as to Philadelphia. Never was a man so readily forgiven. Envy
alone was his enduring enemy, as it always is to great abilities and
to superior personal character.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_77" id="Footnote_3_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_77"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> That cruel urgency, <i>want of space</i>, forbids the insertion here of
many a smart illustrative extract from Cobbett’s American writings.
The following must suffice, being parts of a letter “to the people of
Botley,” dated 10th November, 1818:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“My old Neighbours,&mdash;Great as the distance between you and
me is, I very often think of you, and especially when I buy <i>salt</i>,
which our neighbour Warner used to sell us for 19<i>s.</i> a bushel, and
which I buy here for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> This salt is made, you know, down
somewhere by Hamble. This very salt, when brought here from
England, has all the charges of freight, insurance, wharfage, steerage
to pay. It pays, besides, one third of its value in duty to the
American Government before it be landed here. Then, you will
observe, there is the profit of the American salt merchant; and then
that of the shopkeeper who sells me the salt. And, after all this, I
buy that very Hampshire salt for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a bushel, English measure.
What a Government, then, must that of the borough-mongers be!
The salt is a gift of God. It is thrown on the shore. And yet
these tyrants will not suffer us to use it until we have paid them 15<i>s.</i>
a bushel for liberty to use it.…
</p>
<p>
“You are compelled to pay the borough-mongers a heavy tax on
your <i>candles</i> and <i>soap</i>. You dare not <i>make</i> candles and soap,
though you have the fat and the ashes in abundance. If you
attempt to do this, you are taken up and imprisoned; and if you
resist, soldiers are brought to shoot you. This is <i>freedom</i>, is it?
Now we, here, make our own candles and soap. Farmers sometimes
<i>sell</i> soap and candles, but they never <i>buy</i> any. A labouring
man, or a mechanic, buys a sheep now and then. Three or four
days’ work will buy a labourer a sheep to weigh sixty pounds, with
seven or eight pounds of loose fat. The meat keeps very well, in
winter, for a long time. The wool makes stockings, and the loose
fat is made into candles and soap. The year before I left Hampshire,
a poor woman at Holly Hill had dipped some rushes in
grease to use instead of candles. An exciseman found it out, went
and ransacked her house, and told her that, if the rushes had had
<i>another dip</i>, they would have been <i>candles</i>, and she must have gone
to gaol! Why, my friends, if such a thing were told here, nobody
would believe it.…
</p>
<p>
“I have had living with me an English labourer. He smokes
tobacco, and he tells me that he can buy as much tobacco here for
three cents, that is about three English half-pence, as he could buy in
England for three shillings. The leather has no tax on it here; so
that, though the shoemaker is paid a high price for his labour, the
labouring man gets his shoes very cheap. In short, there is no
excise here, no property tax, no assessed taxes. We have no such
men as Chiddel and Billy Tovey to come and take our money from
us; no window-peepers; no spies to keep a look out as to our carriages,
and horses, and dogs.… We may wear hair-powder if we
like, without paying for it, and a boy in our houses may whet our
knives without our paying 2<i>l.</i> a year for it.”
</p>
<p>
“I have talked to several farmers here about the tithes in
England, and <i>they laugh</i>. They sometimes almost make me angry,
for they seem, at last, not to believe what I say when I tell them
that the English farmer gives, and is compelled to give, the parson
a tenth part of his whole crop, and of his fruit, and milk, and eggs,
and calves, and lambs, and pigs, and wool, and honey. They
cannot believe this. They treat it as a sort of <i>romance</i>.…
</p>
<p>
“To another of my neighbours … I was telling the story
about the poor woman at Holly Hill, who had nearly dipped her
rushes once too often. He is a very grave and religious man. He
looked very seriously at me, and said that falsehood was falsehood,
whether in jest or earnest.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_78" id="Footnote_4_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_78"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> There was a good deal of controversy concerning land-jobbing
in America about this time. Mr. Morris Birkbeck, a prosperous
farmer at Wanborough, in Surrey, left England with some highly
coloured notions in his mind concerning the western territories of
the United States, and produced two separate accounts, with the
object of inducing British emigrants to follow him (“Notes on a
Journey in America, from the Coast of Virginia to the Territory of
Illinois,” and “Letters from Illinois”). Cobbett gave him a letter
or two, under the impression that Birkbeck’s expectations were too
fascinating. Mr. Birkbeck was unfortunately soon afterwards
drowned in crossing a river. Mr. Henry Bradshaw Fearon, surgeon,
went out under the auspices of some emigration committee.
His was a somewhat “evil report,” and amongst other matters
recorded a visit to Cobbett’s house in Long Island, which, he said,
was mouldering to decay, that the fences were in ruins, and that the
scene produced thoughts of melancholy (“Sketches of America: a
Narrative of a Journey of 5000 Miles through the Eastern and
Western States of America; with Remarks on Mr. Birkbeck’s
‘Notes’ and ‘Letters’”). The same candid pen which had endeavoured
to check Birkbeck’s too great enthusiasm now had the duty
to perform of chastising the author of these misrepresentations, and
of Fearon’s general bad account of the Americans. Mr. Benjamin
Flower also travelled westward, and sent home “Letters from the
Illinois” (London, 1822). See, besides these, Faux’s “Memorable
days in America” (London 1823).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_79" id="Footnote_5_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_79"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Mr. Paine has been variously described as a traitor, an apostate,
a seducer, an infidel, a rogue, an outcast, and&mdash;“one of the most
enlightened and benevolent men that ever lived.” The reconciling
of these things must be left to his biographer; meanwhile, the
following facts are all that are necessary to be at present noted:&mdash;Paine
had been an exciseman, and discovered that he could write by
the production of an eloquent pamphlet upon some grievance of the
excise-officers. He had written poems, and enjoyed the friendship
of Oliver Goldsmith. Being introduced to Dr. Franklin, he was
induced to visit Philadelphia; and there he wrote a pamphlet under
the title of “Common Sense,” which is generally asserted to have
been a leading factor in producing the Declaration of Independence,
being read and reprinted by hundreds of thousands. Honours came
upon him; he was made Secretary to Congress for Foreign Affairs,
and remained in America some dozen years. At the outbreak of
the French Revolution, Paine was in London again, enjoying the
friendship of Edmund Burke, whom, from the part the latter took
concerning the American Revolution, Paine “naturally considered
a friend to mankind.” Mr. Burke’s celebrated “Reflections on the
Revolution in France” was, however, the means of sundering this
friendship; and the tract was answered by Paine in “The Rights of
Man,” a pamphlet which produced even more delight among the
advanced liberals of the day than Burke’s had with the terrified
aristocracy. The “answer” to Paine was his “Life,” “by Francis
Oldys, A.M.” (one of the most horrible collections of abuse which
even that venal day produced), written by George Chalmers, a
Government clerk and pamphleteer, who, by the way, did much
better work as an antiquarian and historical compiler. A second
part of “The Rights of Man” followed this, and a Government
prosecution succeeded that. A verdict of guilty, however, found
the culprit a Member of the French National Convention; for no
less than four constituencies had elected him, on his reputation
alone. He sat for Calais; was near losing his head, for his vote on
the side of humanity, when Louis XVI. was arraigned; wrote
“The Age of Reason” in prison; eventually returned to America,
and died (1809) in his seventy-third year, at his farm at New
Rochelle, Long Island; which farm had been the gift of the nation
about a quarter of a century previously.</p>

there is no monument to record” the virtues and sufferings of
Catherine of Arragon, who lies beneath the floor of the Cathedral;
that the remains of Mary Queen of Scots had been taken thence to

judge from the following (from the <i>Statesman</i> [London] newspaper,
Dec. 2, 1819):&mdash;
</p>
<p>
“Manchester, Nov. 29.&mdash;Expected arrival of Mr. Cobbett.&mdash;Though
the morning was very rainy, the expectation of Mr. Cobbett’s
arrival in this town attracted great numbers of persons from
different parts of the country. The local authorities were on the
alert, and military arrangements were made, which were as formidable
as those of the 16th of August. Several pieces of cannon were
brought into the town last night, but the yeomanry cavalry had
received no orders, nor did they make their appearance to-day.
Hussars were stationed on different parts of the Liverpool road, in
order to give immediate information of Mr. C.’s movements.”
</p>
<p>
The Borough reeves and constables placarded the town, recommending
the people to keep within doors, and also addressed Mr.
Cobbett, informing him that if he made a public entry into Manchester,
it would be their “indispensable duty immediately to
interfere.”
</p>
<p>
The Reformers met this with a counter-placard:&mdash;“No procession.&mdash;In
consequence of a placard posted this morning (joined with
military arrangements, similar to those which preceded the fatal
16th of August last), … the <i>real friends</i> of peace (the principal
Reformers of Manchester) request the public not to give the fiends of
St. Peter’s another opportunity of shedding innocent blood, but to
stay at home, and thus disappoint them of their prey.”</p>

<p>“The Real or Constitutional House that Jack Built,” has a cut of

be judged by the following, addressed to the “first gent:”&mdash;</p>

<p>As for the newspaper rhymesters, the episode of “Cobbett and

after this escapade of Cobbett’s. The remains of Major André were
exhumed and brought to England; and, considering that that
unlucky officer met with the usual fate of a detected spy, the circumstance
afforded Mr. Cobbett a fair opportunity of returning some
of the pleasantries. As André’s name has not yet been dropped
from the biographical dictionaries, his story will be found in
“Chambers’s Encyclopædia,” and elsewhere.</p>

himself, and produced one of his best jokes on this occasion.
Referring to the plaintiff’s diminished prospects at the bar, alleged
to be in consequence of these events, he added, “It was held to be
a crime, even by poachers, to destroy young birds; and how
criminal, then, must he (the defendant) be, if he really had <i>crushed a

<p><a name="Footnote_15_89" id="Footnote_15_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_89"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Cobbett’s action with reference to Queen Caroline is another
of those matters which caused unmitigable hatred on the part of the
“first gent” and his ministers. He had contributed, during the
year 1811, to the republication of the notorious “Book,” the entire
impression of which was supposed, till then, to have been destroyed.
On the Queen’s return to England, in 1820, the Reformers took up
her cause with great zeal, under some impression that their own was
identified therewith. Whilst Brougham, and Denman, and the
leading Whigs patronized her in public; Dr. Parr, Alderman Wood,
and Mr. Cobbett were at her elbow behind the scenes. The celebrated
letter from the Queen to the King (which was returned
unopened, but read with eager delight by all the nation) was from
Cobbett’s pen.
</p>
<p>
The whole story is graphically told by Cobbett, in the “History
of the Regency and Reign of George IV.,” and his cotemporary
articles will be found in the <i>Registers</i> of 1820.</p>

sufficient truth to float it.

<p>

“The Gridiron; or, Cook’s Weekly Register.” First number,
March 23, 1822. Here are specimens of it:&mdash;
</p>

from the political world. The time required to effect this, of course,
cannot be distinctly defined.…
</p>
<p>
“In our immediate attacks upon Cobbett, we request our readers
to excuse the coarseness of the language adopted.”
</p>
<p>
“Farmers’ wives.&mdash;It is now but a few years since that an old
shameless, wicked fellow rose up from his bed to pray for your

No. 3 is reduced to sixpence, for the purpose of affording a more

</p>
<p>
All this anonymous rubbish did more good than harm, as obvious
hypocrisy always will, under similar circumstances. A more
respectable opponent was Henry White, a well-known Whig writer
of the day. People said he was jealous of Cobbett. He was a very
able man, and had himself been well abused by the <i>Times</i> and other
papers, on account of his strict partisanship. After many years of
animadversion, he produced “A Calm Appeal to the Friends of
Freedom and Reform, on the Double Dealings of Mr. Cobbett, and
the baneful tendency of his Writings. With a vindication of the
Whigs, and the Patriots of Westminster and the Borough of Southwark,
against his Scurrilous and Malignant Aspersions. By Henry
White, late editor of the <i>Independent Whig</i>, the <i>Charles James Fox</i>,
the <i>Independent Observer</i>, the <i>Sunday Times</i>, the <i>Public Cause</i>, &amp;c.,
&amp;c.” (London, 1823). Referring to his own party, White says,
“What virtue, what wisdom, what real patriotism there is in the
country, he knows <i>they</i> possess.”</p>

<span class="smaller">“THEY COMPLAIN THAT THE TWOPENNY TRASH
IS READ.”</span></h2>

<p>The ruin which was overtaking all the agricultural
interest during the last years of the Regency, put a
finishing stroke to the little estate at Botley. It
had been heavily mortgaged for some years past;
and upon Mr. Cobbett’s return from America, he
found himself stripped of everything in the shape
of realizable property. The profits from the
<i>Register</i> were comparatively smaller than of old;
for, although the circulation was prodigious, the
expense of its distribution was also very great.
The establishment of another daily paper<a name="FNanchor_1_91" id="FNanchor_1_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_91" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> probably
added to his pecuniary difficulties. At last there
was no resource but bankruptcy, which took place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
in the course of 1820. The creditors were few, and
acted very generously; and Mr. Cobbett afterwards
refers to them with the kindliest feelings. One of
them, indeed (Mr. George Rogers, of Southampton),
went further; and paid the damages and costs in
Wright’s action, which followed very soon after the
certificate in bankruptcy was issued. The low ebb
at which his fortunes now stood, are best described
in Cobbett’s own words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In January, 1821, my family, after having for years
been scattered about like a covey of partridges that had
been sprung and shot at, got once more together, in a
hired lodging at Brompton; and our delight, and our
mutual caresses, and our tears of joy, experienced no
abatement at our actually finding ourselves with only
<i>three shillings</i> in the whole world; and at my having to
borrow from a friend the money to pay for the paper and
print off the then next Saturday’s <i>Register</i>!”</p>

</div>

<p>To live in London, however, or even near it without
“fruits and flowers,” was out of the question.
Accordingly, we find Mr. Cobbett soon settled at
Kensington, cultivating a plot of land as a seed-farm;
and his politics and his satire are, thenceforth,
mingled with the mysteries of trees and turnips, corn
and apples. Unable to resume the practice of planting,
for himself, upon a large scale, Mr. Cobbett gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
a great impulse to the formation of plantations, on
the part of gentlemen who could afford to do it.
His old friend, Lord Folkestone, was especially
encouraged to improve the grounds at Coleshill by
further plantings, and covered many acres with
his favourite acacia, then better known under its
American name of locust-tree. So great, indeed,
became the rage for this particular tree, that more
applicants came to Kensington for the seeds than
could be served with those imported from America;
and Cobbett actually had to purchase them sometimes
from the London nurserymen, in whose shops
they were lying neglected under another name.</p>

<p>The story of Cobbett’s planting and seed-farming
would make an interesting volume. It became the
fashion, after his death, to decry his successes,<a name="FNanchor_2_92" id="FNanchor_2_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_92" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and to minimize his qualities as a farmer; and perhaps
with some justice, as regards this latter part of
his life, as his hands were always too full of more
stirring matters. But he did unquestionable service
to the art of planting; and in promoting the restoration
of woods and coppices, which had so fatally
suffered from the felling and clearing brought about
by the war, and by the efforts made by so many
persons to save their property by the sacrifice of its
timber. And, besides this practical part of the
business: ever ready to put his notions into print,
he must needs produce more books, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
popularize his plans; books, however, which have
met with comparative neglect, of late years, on
account of their special nature. Rural economy
and domestic economy are matters which, treated
as social arts, get so modified by the rapidly-changing
currents of our time, that the mode of one
generation is lost amid the fads of the next. But
the peculiar merit of Cobbett’s books was their
readableness; and, whilst such matters as the
Currency and the Corn Laws could be rendered
entertaining by his facile pen, it was natural that
rural affairs, in which he delighted, and amongst
which he heartily believed that the highest domestic
felicity was to be found, should derive from that
pen the highest charms. There never lived, probably,
a writer to equal Cobbett in rural description:
one who could, in the midst of some angry polemic,
so readily turn off for a moment and present his
reader with a country picture; perfectly life-like,
glowing with colour and realism: who could make
a mere gardening book entertaining.</p>

<p>Whilst in Long Island, Mr. Cobbett had prepared
an “American Gardener,” which he published, soon
after his return to England; dedicating it to one of
his neighbours out there. The “English Gardener,”
published a few years later, was a reproduction of
this, adapted to the differing conditions of his own
country. “The Woodlands,” published early in
1825; a new edition of Tull’s old book on “Horse-hoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>ing
Husbandry,” in 1822; and a guide for the
cultivation of Indian corn, completed a useful series
of books on rural affairs. All these are marked by
sufficient egotism; but they are far more practical
than the general run of such works. There is so
much painstaking description, and so much lively
illustration, that the reader is forced to take an
interest in what he is reading. It is almost impossible
for one to take in hand the “Woodlands,”
without wishing to become a planter.</p>

<p>The “Cottage Economy” was a small work, exclusively
for the use of cottagers, with the aim of
bringing them back to the habits and ways of their
grandparents; in reviving the arts of making bread
and brewing beer at home; of keeping cows,
poultry, and bees; and, generally, showing the way
to become independent of shopkeepers and tax-gatherers.
All this Cobbett had seen in his youth,
and he was determined to revive these things, if it
was to be done. And the immediate popularity of
these rural books, coming, as they did, at a period
when people were making most desperate efforts to
keep the wolf from the door, showed forth an unquestionable
fact,&mdash;that the people wanted sympathy and
guidance, and the means of self-improvement, and
were well satisfied to get so much from the man who
was fighting their battles for them in another way.</p>

<p>As one example of the amount of influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Cobbett obtained over people, in minor domestic
matters, the following may be given:&mdash;From a
farmer’s daughter in Connecticut, who had sent
over to the Society of Arts a straw-bonnet of her
own making, he obtained some particulars as to the
mode of preparation. Having published the matter
in the <i>Register</i>, an importer of Italian straw applied
to Mr. Cobbett, requesting to know whether he
could undertake to get some American straw imported.
Upon seeing some samples of the straw
from which the Leghorn hats were made, and looking
at it “with the eyes of a farmer,” he perceived
that it consisted of dry oat, wheat, and rye stalks,
mixed with those of certain common grass plants.
This discovery made it clear to him that there was
no need of importation; and, proceeding in his
usual energetic way, he soon had straw hats and
bonnets prepared from English grasses. This
opened up a new industry, not only in the homes
of the labourers, but on the part of some manufacturers;
and its success was so far recognizable,
that the Society of Arts, in the year 1823, gave Mr.
Cobbett their silver medal, as a token of their
approbation. <span class="smcap">Envy</span> caught sight of this, of course,
and asserted itself as usual, with newspaper paragraphs
headed, “The Society of Arts humbugged
at last!” and so on; but what was that, to disturb
the well-earned delight of the man who could ride
about the country, and see and hear for himself
many a poor cottager at work, otherwise unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
earn a livelihood: who could print letters of grateful
thanks from every quarter of the kingdom?</p>

<p>The attempt to naturalize the maize plant was
another singular effort of Mr. Cobbett’s; the complete
success of which, however, was too much to
expect from the English climate. But, by the
application of a good deal of zealous labour and
attention, many persons did succeed in producing
good crops; and there was not only bread made
from “Cobbett’s corn,” but paper was made from
the stalks.</p>

<p>A most particular aversion of Mr. Cobbett’s was
the potato.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This root is become a favourite because it is the suitable
companion of misery and filth. It can be seized
hold of before it be half ripe, it can be raked out of the
ground with the paws, and without the help of any
utensils except, perhaps, a stick to rake it from the fire,
can be conveyed into the stomach, in the space of an
hour. We have but one step farther to go, and that is,
to eat it raw, side by side with our bristly fellow-creatures,
who, by-the-bye, reject it as long as they can get at any
species of grain, or at any other vegetable. I can remember
when the first acre of potatoes was planted in a
field, in the neighbourhood of the place where I was
born; and I very well remember that even the poorest of
the people would not eat them. They called them hog-potatoes;
but now they are become a considerable
portion of the diet of those who raise the bread for
others to eat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>This passage is from a Botley <i>Register</i>, of 1813;
but it will represent Cobbett’s notions and feelings
on the matter during all his life&mdash;from the scarcity-period
at the beginning of the century (when bills
were introduced in Parliament to “encourage” the
growth of potatoes; and Ministers of State, at their
grand dinners, used fried potato-cakes, as a substitute
for bread), to the time when he came to predict
a disastrous Irish famine. And it would be hard
to deny the force of his arguments; the burden of
which was, that in order to keep a people in a condition
of semi-barbarism, little else was necessary
than to cause potatoes to be the general food of the
country. A knife (he pointed out) which even
savages rarely dispense with, is not required by the
feeder on potatoes. No forethought, and only a
minimum of industrious attention, are needed.
The love of ease, so natural to mankind, soon
prevails, in the absence of incitement to labour&mdash;a
safe commonplace; but one of vital importance to
be borne in mind, when the thoughtless, and the
ignorant, and the purse-proud are content to see a
whole class of their fellow-beings ranked just above
the swine.</p>

<p>Some curious notions used to get afloat, concerning
cheap food for the poor. There was the
Duke of Richmond’s celebrated discovery of the
nourishing qualities of curry-powder; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>and the
recipe of another clever fellow, for making <i>flint-soup</i>.
Milk, produced by animals fed upon stewed
straw, was discovered to have great fattening
properties.…</p>

<p>Yet, with all this considerate device, the ungrateful
wretches still whined for their beer and bread
and bacon, the dietary of their forefathers. And the
editor of a certain “diabolical” publication persisted
in telling them that they ought to have it, and they
could have it; for, at the time that the ordinary
Wiltshire fare was <i>1¼ pound of bread and a halfpenny</i>
per day, he was giving to his own labourers, at
Barn Elm, 1 lb. of meat or bacon, 1½ lb. of flour,
besides cheese and beer, per day; and three shillings
a week in money.</p>

<p>And there was so much wanton cruelty and insolence,
under the poor-relief system of those days.
Gangs of labourers would be set to work, the leader
having a bell round his neck; men were set to <i>draw</i>
carts, like so many convicts, instead of using wheel-barrows;
and, when there was no immediate work
on hand, you might see one carrying a heavy stone
up and down; or digging a hole in the ground one
day, and filling it up again the next. How all this
went on, in England, for ten or twelve years, scarce
half a century ago, is past comprehending. It is,
however, a fact, that people could not only permit
it, but permit it without shame; and could venture
to call those persons “diabolical villains,” who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
blushed for the country which proclaimed itself “the
envy of surrounding nations.”</p>

<p>Those who blushed for their country: those who
spent their lives in the endeavour to arrest the hand
of her oppressors: justly scorned the pleas of submission
and contentment, put forth by many well-meaning
persons in the shape of “religious” tracts.
The man before us (one of that class who practise
a good deal more than they preach; who act
righteously before they inculcate righteousness on
the part of others) could only see, in these precious
handbills, inducements to submit to social degradation.
But, in truth, acute suffering on the part of
the labouring-classes was teaching them as much
as Mr. Cobbett, or any one else, could do. To see
the name of some fat pluralist on the title-page of
a tract against “repining;” to listen to advice and
exhortation, based on the comforting prospects of
another and better world, on the part of men who
were themselves making sure of this one; to see
the names of the committees and promoters of this
officious piety, and find that they were, in many
instances, the names of those who had given a
helping-hand to repression; and who continued
to inculcate passive obedience, and the extreme
naughtiness of the poor wretches in wanting to
know something about the real causes of their
misery, was too much for millions of the unprivileged
and unendowed. They could see, plainly enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>,
who were the real Sowers of the Wind. And,
perhaps, the Church of England has come to see,
for herself, how we have reaped a whirlwind of
religious indifference; in spite of “revivals,” and
“restorations,” and “extensions,” and “functions,”
and potterings without number.<a name="FNanchor_3_93" id="FNanchor_3_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_93" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not the least important contribution to the cause
of the people, on the part of Mr. Cobbett, was his
“History of the Reformation.” A curiosity in
literature; a clumsy, hastily-drawn indictment; the
sport of Protestant controversialists; the work yet
served a noble purpose. The scale of misrepresentation
and calumny had been too long on one side,
and there wanted a thumping weight to restore the
balance. And when the world discovered tha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>t the
story of the Reformation in England had its very
dark as well as its very bright side: when people
learned what utterly selfish ends it had promoted:
the world took a long step forward; stepped up to
scrutinize it closely. And if the world found that the
rough rude hand of this literary pre-raphaelite had
brought some features into disgusting prominence,
it was no more than was to be expected, sooner
or later. The mere controversy, concerning the
mutual recriminations of Papists and Protestants,
and concerning their cutting of each other’s throats,
is nothing. All that will be going on when the New
Zealander comes. But the political nature of that
great convulsion, and its important social results,
particularly with regard to the shameless transfer of
property into the hands of court-favourites, had
need to be shown up with a relentless hand.</p>

<p>The occasion, of this “History of the Reformation”
being projected, was the rapidly-growing feeling
on the subject of Emancipation. Mr. Cobbett
had long proclaimed equality of political rights for
the Catholic, the Unitarian, and the Jew; and
regarded them as oppressed people, as long as their
theological disabilities remained.<a name="FNanchor_4_94" id="FNanchor_4_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_94" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> We laugh
now-a-days, at such fears as then existed concerning
the removal of these disabilities; but we are <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>out
of the wood; and the few persons of superior mental
stature who, in those times, persisted in declaring
to the cowards beneath them, that there was more
safety in moving on, than in standing still, had to
make their voices heard above a fearful din, of incrimination,
and calumny, and petty party strifes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>So, by the time that the cause of Emancipation
had taken hold of the public mind: when the press,
at last, took it up warmly, and O’Connell was leading
the agitation in Ireland: Cobbett had lashed
himself into a perfect fury, toward the opponents
of religious equality, and toward the inheritors of
the Church domains. The ease-loving character of
the parsons of his day, the growth of a plutocracy,
and the debased condition of the poor: spake too
ominously of national decadence. The increasing
perils of the country, with all parties trying, at last,
to propitiate the Parliamentary Reformers at the
same time that they had mortal dread of them, kept
his mind at fever-heat; and Mr. Cobbett was less
than ever disposed to stay his voice or his pen, when
conviction had once seized him. He had nothing
to gain, and nothing to lose, by expressing his convictions.
Given a fight, he was certain to be seen
in the thickest of it.</p>

<p>The urgency of the matter, and the readiness of
the public mind to accept a broader view of the
Reformation story, were shown, by the immediate
success of the History. Published weekly, at a low
price, the early numbers reached a sale of upwards
of forty thousand; and very little time elapsed,
before the work had flown all over Europe and
America. The fanatics did not like it, and they
don’t like it now.<a name="FNanchor_5_95" id="FNanchor_5_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_95" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> There are persons about us, in
these latter days, who consider Emancipation as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
one of our great national sins, on account of which
we shall yet be heavily scourged. “<span class="smcap">Let them
curse, but bless thou!</span>”</p>

<p>The thing did not aim at pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>selytism; the writer
had no intention, nor any expectation, of that. He
did expect, however, to see thousands and thousands
of converts to the cause of tolerance; and
there can be no doubt whatever, that Cobbett’s
“History of the Reformation” gave immense
impulse to that cause. And, if the book had only
been called “The History of the Great Spoliation,”
the fanatics would have been disarmed, and perhaps
joined with the author in his passionate denunciations;
instead of wilfully and wickedly misconstruing
his motives, and distorting his arguments.</p>

<p>But the prejudice with which we go through
the world is quite as gross as the ignorance with
which we enter it; and when we have stuck up
such a word as <i>Reformation</i>, and fallen down and
worshipped it for a time, we soon become incapable
of forming just judgments.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The list of Mr. Cobbett’s books, which were
directly intended to help the cause to which his
life was devoted, is complemented by adding to the
above-named, “The Poor Man’s Friend;” “Twelve
Sermons;” and “The Emigrant’s Guide.” The first
of these he called the most learned work that he
had ever written. It consisted principally of short
papers on the rights and duties of the poor; which
were published monthly, and addressed to the
working-people of Preston, after his unsuccessful contest
at the election. But the Sermons are better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
deserving of the palm of superiority. The reader
cannot open a page of this volume, without being
powerfully struck with Cobbett’s ability to handle
any subject illustrating man’s duty to his neighbour.
Of course, there is a little touch of politics underlying
it all, although only perceptible to one
familiar with his political writings; but it is not
one whit too much to say, that this volume of
sermons would do honour to any Divine, in any
Christian Church.</p>

<p>The “Sermons” had a tremendous popularity, for
several years. As monthly tracts, they had been
originally published in avowed rivalry to the vapid
productions of religious doctrinaires, and of the
preachers of contentment and resignation under
conditions of obvious misgovernment. Some of the
clergy had the good sense to use Cobbett’s sermons
in their own pulpits; it is to be hoped without
generally avowing the source of their inspiration.
One reflection persists in intruding itself upon the
reader of these tracts; that when men come to
enter the ministry, after having been buffeted about
the world a bit, and having learned something of
human nature, instead of being delivered from a
cloister (as from some manufactory), they will
understand their business better, and soon have less
cause to whine about the “spread” of infidelity and
immorality. Until then, things will go on as they
do now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That racy volume, “Rural Rides,” came forth to
the world in a sufficiently unpretending manner.
It was a mere reprint of articles from the <i>Register</i>,
which had been generally written at the close of a
day’s journey, and without any special object but
current reports upon the condition of the people
and the country. But none of Cobbett’s writings
have been so much quoted as the “Rural Rides,”
a fact which is easily understood, considering the
circumstance that what would deter most people
from literary drudgery, was the very reverse to Mr.
Cobbett. A day’s exercise would impart fresh
vigour to his mind, and wings to his pen; and the
result is, in this case, one of the very liveliest books
in the English language.</p>

<p>It was in the autumn of 1821 that the first
journal was undertaken. Cobbett’s own affairs were
getting more comfortable; he lived quietly at
Kensington, not often troubling himself with the
publishing-office; and the experiment, of going
round to see the farmers for himself, was just in his
vein. Agricultural distress was nearly at its worst,
and the troubles of the farmers formed the leading
topic of the day. Beef and mutton fetched an
average of 4½<i>d.</i> per lb., in the month of November;
and all rural produce was at a similarly reduced
figure. So Mr. Cobbett started off, on horseback,
through Berkshire and Wiltshire to Gloucester an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>d
Hereford, returning by Oxford to Kensington; with
such satisfaction, that he spent much of the winter
in similar journeys through parts of southern
England. All his intense interest in rural affairs,
and the welfare of the country folk: his close observations
on soil, and climate, and produce, and his
sarcastic reflections on domestic politics, were here
served up for his readers in better style than ever.
And, at last, having employed a part of the ensuing
four or five years in the same manner, and reprinting
the journals into a volume, the result was a
picture of the cotemporary domestic affairs of
England which it would be vain to seek elsewhere.
In short, given an inquiry into the condition of the
people, at this troublesome period, there could not,
possibly, be better means of enlightenment than
that of taking Cobbett’s “Rural Rides;” and, making
it the basis of such inquiry, to group around it
the necessary information and statistics furnished
by official reports. While, to the value of Cobbett’s
accurate and vivid descriptions of rural scenery, the
use made of the “Rural Rides,” on the part of
guide-book makers, is sufficient testimony.</p>

<p>The more important result, personally, of these
rural journeys, was the frequent opportunity afforded
to Mr. Cobbett of meeting the farmers at their
market dinners and county meetings. This added
immensely to his influence; his opinions, especially
on the currency, began to take hold upon men, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>who
had hitherto read his writings with some degree of
dislike and dread; and a very short time elapsed,
before there were found more Cobbettites in the
country towns, than in the larger centres of population.</p>

<p>Another series of rural rides was commenced in
1829. These were more distinctively political tours;
and extended to more distant parts, including
the manufacturing towns of Yorkshire and Lancashire.
The reception Mr. Cobbett met with, and the
overflowing attendances upon his lectures, showed,
in a surprising degree, the hold he had obtained
upon the minds of the working-people. Parliamentary
Reform was, at last, no longer to be delayed;
and while the Russells and the Greys were getting
a due share of credit, for their endeavours to force
on the Great Plunge, there was no questioning to
whom principally belonged the distinction of having
made it inevitable.</p>

269, Strand) was started on the 29th January, 1820, and ran for
about two months. The early numbers are largely devoted to the
Coventry election. On the 28th March a notice is given that the
paper will be discontinued, with a remark that, “at the time when
this undertaking was resolved on, it was uncertain what one could
do, and could not do, in the state of slavery in which the new laws
placed the press.” The <i>Register</i> was missed on one or two occasions,
and it was found that the attempt to carry on both would be “to
make both indifferent;” besides, people both preferred the <i>Weekly

his powers.</p>

such cool impudence, in their affected contempt of the understanding

hear them talking of the English Constitution as the pride of the

they lived and died in the Catholic faith, and that, notwithstanding
their Catholic faith, they did not neglect whatever was necessary to
the freedom and greatness of England. It is really very stupid, as

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="smaller">“I HAVE PLEADED THE CAUSE OF THE WORKING-PEOPLE,
AND I SHALL NOW SEE THAT
CAUSE TRIUMPH.”</span></h2>

<p>The disinclination on the part of Mr. Cobbett
to become a member of Parliament, which had
long characterized his taste as a public character,
was now changed into an earnest determination
the other way. At any time since 1803 he could
have done so, either by the good offices of Mr.
Windham, or of Viscount Folkestone. But a close
borough was his abomination; and his dislike for
late hours and London smoke, and his general
feeling of contempt for the character of the existing
representation, rendered a seat in the House of
Commons anything but an object of ambition.
Besides, he held, for a long time, the notion, that
he could render better services to his country as a
representative of the press.</p>

<p>The daring outrages on the popular liberties,
however, which had begun under the Regency,
changed all this. The character of the House was
still pretty much the same, even with the a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>ccession
of lucky war-contractors and stock-jobbers; and
the type of ministerialists was still that of the
Perceval set, which had existed since 1807. But
now, under Habeas Corpus Suspension, the outlook
has changed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The <i>press</i> is a very powerful engine. Corruption
trembles at the very thought of it. The press has done
wonderful things. But, great as I know its power to be,
I know it to be a mere trifle compared to <i>a seat in Parliament</i>,
filled by an able, a sober, an industrious, an
active, a vigilant, a resolute, an experienced, and an
incorruptible man, who would devote his time and his
mind to the service of the country. To be sure, <i>one</i>
man could do comparatively little, without the aid of at
least <i>another</i>.… One man, such as I have described,
would soon make <i>other men</i>. A knot of such men
would, in a short time, grow together; and against such
a knot, corruption would not live a year.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is the midst of the “repression” period, in the
winter of 1817-18, when the news reaches him at
Long Island, of men suffering severe penalties for
acts of violence. He thus addresses the electors
of Coventry, begging them to have “but a little
<i>patience</i>.” … “Let us bear in mind, that a <i>people</i>
never dies; and let us also bear in mind the final
success which, in all their struggles, crowned the
patience, the perseverance, the public spirit and the
valour of our forefathers, who never set to work
against oppression without subduing it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
end.” … But:&mdash;“I am against all desperate
means. I am for trying all the <i>gentle means</i> that
remain; and, as I have just said, the putting of
proper men into Parliament appears to me to be
amongst the most efficient of those means.”</p>

<p>Some few weeks after Cobbett’s return to England,
George the Third died. A general election
shortly ensued, and the opportunity of contesting
one of the seats for Coventry then occurred. The
voters resident in London had been for some time
preparing, by public meetings, to advance Cobbett’s
claims on the constituency; and he now presented
himself in the city, being received with acclamations
on the part of many thousands of people.</p>

<p>But the acclamations of the “lower orders,” as
they drew Mr. Cobbett’s vehicle into and around
the town, were not voting-power. The election
was like elections ordinarily were in those days.
Fighting, stabbing, spitting; swearing, and slandering:
little hired regiments of roughs prevented
anything like fair play; and, although Cobbett
headed the poll on the first day, his ultimate failure
was complete. Indeed, upon the second day, it
was impossible for his supporters to get near the
polling-booth, without the risk of being stabbed.<a name="FNanchor_1_96" id="FNanchor_1_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_96" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The constituency of Coventry was a very fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
one of which to make trial; being a populous
manufacturing place, containing a good body of
reformers, and electors numbering about 2500.
But the corporation was dead against the popular
candidate, actively supporting his opponents (Edward
Ellice, merchant, and Peter Moore, nabob);
and a cartload of money was spent in treating
and ruffianism. Mr. Cobbett’s expenses were
defrayed partly by a small subscription.</p>

<p>It was six years before another opportunity
occurred of meeting a popular constituency, with
any prospect of success. But the question was
kept alive, of a seat in Parliament. Reformers
were sanguine that the franchise was on the eve
of being broadened; and the yeomanry were
beginning to join them,&mdash;a circumstance which
brought into being a more influential class of
adherents to Mr. Cobbett and his views. One
of the more zealous and active of these new
friends was Sir Thomas Beevor, a young baronet
of Norfolk. He had read the <i>Register</i> for the first
time, during the American exile; and his admiration
for the courageous writer so grew upon him,
that he at last publicly declared himself a Cobbettite
and raised a reform camp in his own county.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> A
proposal was at length made,<a name="FNanchor_2_97" id="FNanchor_2_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_97" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to hold a meeting
in London in support of Cobbett’s claims to a
seat in Parliament; but it was relinquished, for the
present, upon Cobbett’s suggestion that they might
properly wait until there was a certain prospect
of a dissolution.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all the matters upon which the
moderate reformers had set their hearts were
canvassed in the <i>Political Register</i> from time to
time: the Game laws and iniquities, Catholic
emancipation, the freedom of public speech, the
continued distress of the Agricultural interest;
along with minor topics, from the hypocrisies in
Parliament, to the extortions of the toll-farmers.
Much of Mr. Cobbett’s influence had been imperilled
by his last American trip, and some of its consequences.
But his espousal of the cause of Queen
Caroline appears to have completely restored him
to his place in the popular mind; and, from that
period onward, not all the base slanders which w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>ere
still showered upon him, nor even his own extravagant
vehemence, could rob him of his power.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1826, a renewed
effort was made, led by Sir Thomas Beevor, to
bring Mr. Cobbett before some constituency. A
meeting was held in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, of a very
enthusiastic character; and, in a few weeks, several
hundred pounds were subscribed. Cobbett, on
his part, was determined to make a good fight this
time; and he announced that, if elected at all,
he must be chosen by persons who chose him for
the good of the country, and not for their own
profit: that if returned at all, it must be by no
corrupt or infamous means; and must be for a
place “where some considerable number of the
people have something to say in the matter.”</p>

<p>Westminster was thought of, and so was Middlesex;
both constituencies in the hands of a narrow
clique. It was, however, decided to fix upon Preston,
as a town affording the desirable element of a very
wide suffrage.<a name="FNanchor_3_98" id="FNanchor_3_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_98" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Accordingly, the prorogation of
Parliament, on the 31st of May, found Mr. Cobbett
canvassing the electors. A famous contest ensued:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the other candidates being the Hon. E. G. Stanley
(afterwards 14th Earl Derby), John Wood, merchant,
and Captain Barrie, R.N.; the two first
being elected. The numbers were, Stanley 3041,
Wood 1982, Barrie 1657, Cobbett 995. There was
comparatively little ruffianism, but sufficient impediment
to fair voting.<a name="FNanchor_4_99" id="FNanchor_4_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_99" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Mr. Cobbett talked, for
some time afterward, of a petition against the
return, but the idea was relinquished. Indeed, he
took this defeat in remarkably good humour; and
proceeded to console himself and his friends, by
recounting those triumphs which he could boast of.</p>

<p>Those were not mean triumphs, although principally
at the hands of the “lower orders.” Flags
and music: shouting, exulting, and shaking of
hands, attended his progress through Blackburn,
Bolton, and Manchester, on his way homeward.<a name="FNanchor_5_100" id="FNanchor_5_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_100" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>It was now quite obvious that popular candidate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>s
stood little or no chance, even in the most popular
boroughs, in the existing state of the representation.
But the prospect of any reform seemed more
distant than ever. In Parliament, the question
was practically shelved. Lord John Russell seemed,
for the time, to have a persuasion that there was
little encouragement to press the matter; and Mr.
Canning, soon after becoming premier in 1827,
declared that he would oppose parliamentary
reform to the end of his life, under whatever shape
it might appear. Burdett said that “putting aside
all the great questions, including among the rest
that of Parliamentary Reform,”<a name="FNanchor_6_101" id="FNanchor_6_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_101" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> he saw sufficient
reason to support Canning’s administration. And
Brougham did not consider that “the late opposition”
stood pledged in favour of the question!</p>

<p>Is it any wonder that Whiggism is dead and
buried? Call not the Russells and the Greys
<i>Whigs</i>: they had deserted the practices (considered
apart from the professions) of their party before
becoming reformers. If Whiggism had been anything
besides profession, parliamentary reform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
would have been undertaken twenty years before;
and the Whigs, as a party, had nothing more to
do with it, when it was at last undertaken, than
to be the vehicle of the country’s earnest demand.</p>

<p>This is how it came to pass. The French and
Belgian revolutions, in the year 1830, powerfully
moved all the populations of Europe; and the
news of that double convulsion reached the people
of England at one of the saddest periods of their
history. To quote Mr. Molesworth,<a name="FNanchor_7_102" id="FNanchor_7_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_102" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> “they were
going mad with misery.” Machine-breaking and
rick-burning kept the country alive with alarm, and
sent some poor wretches to banishment or to death.
People in the towns began to growl again, as they
had growled ten or twelve years before. And the
leaders of reform took fresh heart; for they saw
that the question could no longer be stifled, with
the country in a greater state of degradation than
under the Tories of 1817.</p>

<p>So, in the midst of all this trouble, a Reform
Bill was introduced. And, looking at the subsequent
history of the struggle, and its consequences,
it is impossible to avoid this conclusion: that the
same prosperity and public confidence, which
ensued upon the Act of 1832, might have been the
guerdon of the Tories, at the beginning of the
century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The writings of Mr. Cobbett had been very
severe upon the Whigs. There does not appear
any time, in his whole political life, when he had
not more or less distrusted them. And, now that
the leaders of the party were in power, the individuals
themselves were not spared. Cobbett hit
off with accuracy, and with bitterest irony, their
waverings and inconsistencies. No sooner had
George the Fourth shuffled off this mortal coil,
than he announced a “History of the Regency and
the late Reign;” and, as the successive numbers
of the work appeared, the Whigs had the felicity
of seeing their old place-hunting fully exposed.
Upon the appointment of Earl Grey’s ministry, he
declared his belief that they would keep on talking,
and speechifying, as of old, without any regard to
the promises they had been holding out to the
people. Putting a list of twenty-six questions,
referring to reform, taxation, tyrannous restraints
on liberty, pensions, the six Acts, reduction of the
forces, poor laws and game laws, he gave his
opinion that none of these things would be touched.
And Mr. Cobbett was right; none of these matters
were dealt with, except on pressure from without,
or on the part of sturdy and independent men of
the class of Joseph Hume.</p>

<p>All this told upon the pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>rty newly raised to
power. Very naturally. But they must have felt
a certain insecurity of tenure, to resort to the same
mode of retaliation which their political adversaries
had exercised, twenty years before. So soon does
a lease of power translate itself into a mere parade
of force. The Government had not been many
weeks in office, before they had the abominable
folly to charge Cobbett with being the instigator
of the incendiary fires which were then devastating
the agricultural districts of England!</p>

<p>This was the basest attempt to destroy Mr.
Cobbett that had yet been tried. The end of it
was one of the greatest triumphs of his life; and a
lesson on political prosecutions, which the other
side took much to heart.</p>

<p>The circumstances are these:&mdash;The <i>Political
Register</i> had been, for several years past, sold at
the high price of sevenpence (and sometimes one
shilling for a double number), on account of the
restrictive stamp laws; and it was believed that
the circulation was not of that character which
would bring the journal into the hands of the
labouring classes, to the extent desired. Mr. Cobbett
was determined, however, that he would continue,
in some way or other, to instruct the labouring-classes
in the elements of political and social
economy. This became urgent, during the growing
excitement of 1830; and the difficulty was met by
reprinting portions in a cheap form, and making
a monthly publication thereof. The scornful name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
which Canning had given to the early cheap
<i>Registers</i> was the one adopted; and thus, on the
1st of July, came into the world the first number
of “Cobbett’s Twopenny Trash, or Politics for the
Poor.” The success of 1816 was repeated, and
“Twopenny Trash” flew all over the kingdom:
to the very particular horror of the yet undiminished
number of pensioners and sinecurists, and of non-resident
parsons.<a name="FNanchor_8_103" id="FNanchor_8_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_103" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>As the winter drew near, the accounts of the
rural war were appalling. Incendiary fires, and
threatening letters, were sending the farmers out of
their wits; and fire-engines and man-traps became
part of the farming implements. The labourers,
in their ignorance, rendered desperate with hunger,
proceeded from outrage to outrage, recklessly
destroying food and property; quite unable to
understand why anybody else could want anything
to eat, if they, the producers, were to do wi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>thout.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, Mr. Cobbett came
amongst them, both on paper and in person; endeavouring
to cheer them with hopes of early
relief, and to warn them against violence:
“Poverty” (he said), “even in its extreme state,
gives no man a right to view his rich neighbour
with an evil eye, much less to do him mischief on
account of his riches.”</p>

<p>But he also told the “King’s Ministers” how to
put a stop to the fires, and that they had better do
something, for the poor ignorant rural labourer
“would not lay down and die;” endeavoured to
palliate the conduct of the labourers, in that they
could not live any longer on potatoes and salt;
ridiculed the idea that more soldiers were wanted
(as had been proposed) in order to keep the country
quiet; taunted the Government with their
apparent helplessness after so much trumpeting
of “glorious” principles and good intentions.</p>

<p>The storm began by a motion, on the part of
Mr. Trevor, member for New Romney, aimed at
“the publication entitled Cobbett’s Register, of the
11th of December;” which he said contained a
malicious libel on “the authorities of the State,”
and a gross and unwarrantable attack on “the
members of the Church by law established.” The
motion was opposed on the ground that a prosecution,
such as was aimed at, would be both impolitic
and ill-timed; and that the proper corrective was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
an improved state of the public mind, by the diffusion
of sound knowledge and useful instruction. It
was ultimately agreed to leave the matter to the
discretion of Ministers.<a name="FNanchor_9_104" id="FNanchor_9_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_104" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>About the same time, one Thomas Goodman, a
Sussex labourer, was sentenced to death for arson;
and there appeared in the newspapers a short
“confession,” which had been wrung from him
by a Sussex parson. A few days after, a longer
confession appeared; and after that a third, still
longer. Mr. Thomas Goodman was eventually respited,
and never heard of more; and his escape
could only be accounted for, by any rational mind,
in his having inculpated Cobbett as the wicked instigator
of his crime.<a name="FNanchor_10_105" id="FNanchor_10_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_105" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The animus of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> clergy was especially shewn
toward Mr. Cobbett, on account of his attacks on
the tithes: which he continued to maintain were
(originally) in part intended for the use of the poor.
The “gross and unwarrantable attack” alluded to
by Mr. Trevor, was the showing-up of a Suffolk
parson; who had made an infamous and lying
attack upon Cobbett. Now, some of the more sensible
parsons were endeavouring to meet the sad
necessities of the day; one worthy Norfolk clergyman,
for example, on being petitioned for a reduction
of his tithes, sent answer that he “should be
satisfied with whatever they might send him.” But
the fat pluralists, and the numerous lazy class of
that day, were too blind with selfish rage to listen
to any reason. The present sufferer from Cobbett’s
lash was one of these.<a name="FNanchor_11_106" id="FNanchor_11_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_106" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>So, with idle shepherds cu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>rsing, and newspapers
inventing new calumnies, the Government thought
they had a case; and an indictment was preferred
against Mr. Cobbett, for “a libel, with the intent to
raise discontent in the minds of the labourers in
husbandry, and to incite them to acts of violence,
and to destroy corn-stacks, machinery, and other
property.” After some delays, the affair was at
last heard in the Court of King’s Bench, on
the 7th July, 1831; Lord Tenterden being judge
on the occasion, and Sir Thomas Denman, as Attorney-General,
conducting the prosecution. The
principal Cabinet Ministers were on the bench,
(having been subpœnaed by the defendant); as
also was his old friend, the Earl of Radnor, who
had voluntarily determined to give Cobbett an
opportunity of calling him as a witness, if he chose.
The defendant appeared in person.</p>

<p>From beginning to end of this trial, it was a
manifest error. Denman began with the ridiculous
statement that “he understood” that the defendant
had “entered the court at the head of a large number
of persons whom he had called together by
notice;” and proceeded to exhort the jury “to
yield to nothing like menace or intimidation, which
conduct so improper is calculated and probabl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>y intended
in some degree to produce.” And his whole
speech was one long, groundless imputation, unsupported
by a shred of evidence; and based on the
fact (which nobody denied, for it was indisputable)
which the defendant had clearly pointed out: the
close connexion between the reckless conduct of the
labourers, on the one hand, and the cause of that
conduct; and its results (such as the cheapening
of food, and the sudden reduction of the tithes) on
the other.</p>

<p>The “extract” from the offending number of the
<i>Register</i>, which formed the basis of the indictment, did
not include those parts of the essay, which said that
the acts of the labourers were unlawful; which quoted
the current newspaper stories about the Suffolk
clergy who could not get in their tithes: which
reminded the Whigs how their praises had been
derived from yet-unfulfilled promises: which hit
at the newspapers and the borough-mongers;
which quoted Bacon and Blackstone; which advocated
honesty and freedom of election; which proclaimed,
“I am for a Government of King, Lords,
and Commons; but, let what else will come, I am
for the freedom, the happiness and greatness of
England; and, above all things, for the good feeding
and clothing of those who raise all the food, and
make all the clothing!” No: these would have
been the remainder of his argument, and would
have enabled a jury not only to understand i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>ts
whole drift and tenour, but to pronounce the writer
a truly wise and patriotic man.</p>

<p>Some of the jury did, evidently, consider the
matter a gross absurdity; for, being locked up all
night, the twelve were unable to agree to a verdict,
and they were forthwith discharged.<a name="FNanchor_12_107" id="FNanchor_12_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_107" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Cobbett’s long speech, in his defence, must
have made some of his audience feel grievously
uncomfortable. No one was spared; not a soul,
whose delinquencies could possibly illustrate the
case. There were the Cabinet Ministers sitting in
a row before him (including the Chancellor, Brougham),
being scolded for their perfidy toward the
people; there was the Attorney-General himself,
whose promotion in his profession had actually been
retarded, on account of his firm adherence to the
Whig cause&mdash;now prosecuting the press with
greater zeal than his Tory predecessor; there were
the magistrates who had extorted or invented Goodman’s
confession; and there were the party newspapers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
with their transparent falsehoods, weather-cock
principles, and questionable motives: all
scolded anew. All who had contributed, in any
degree, to the climax which ended in this trial,
were covered with deserved ridicule.</p>

<p>The speech occupied several hours, and it would
take nearly fifty of our pages to reproduce it. The
points relied on for the defence were, that the
indictment contained only garbled extracts from an
article which had, as a whole, the exact opposite of
the tendency imputed to it; that the Society for
the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (of which society
Brougham and Denman were both leading members!)
had recently asked Cobbett’s permission to
reprint his celebrated Letter to the Luddites against
machine-breaking and other violence, with the
same objects in view that he had himself; that Mr.
Goodman, labourer and incendiary, had been pardoned,
or had unaccountably disappeared, since his
“confession,” and that there was a letter (which
Cobbett produced, and read) written by Goodman
himself, totally different in style and spelling; that
the <i>Times</i> newspaper had recently libelled the
judges, and called the close-borough members
“the hired lacqueys of public delinquents,” and yet
was unmolested as long as it continued to puff the
Ministry; that a declaration from the tradesmen
and labourers in and around Battle (who had heard
Cobbett’s lectures), made it clear that the per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>sons
who had produced the three confessions
were.… No, Mr. Cobbett did not apply to
their conduct the terms that it deserved, but contented
himself with reading the declaration; and,
the notorious fact that he had spent the best part
of his life in the endeavour to instruct the labouring
classes, in the arts of happiness and goodness.</p>

<p>The speech of the defendant was occasionally
interrupted by applause; and once by the judge,
on the score of irrelevancy; an objection, however,
which was not sustained. And a stray joke or two
shone out, as when Cobbett spoke of Mr. Gurney
(junior counsel) as “a mere truffle-hunter; he neither
sees nor smells anything but the immediate
object of his search,” in allusion to his special
search of the <i>Register</i> for indictable matter; or in
his sarcastic reference to the “open, fair, and candid,”
professions of the Attorney-General, which he
said were traceable not to the wig on his head, but
to the whig in his heart; and in such a passage as
this, his humour would prevail:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Such are the odious and foul calumnies which have
been heaped upon me, that I dare say you expected to
see me hoofed and horned, a pair of horns on my head
and hoofs up to my knees, terminating with a cloven foot.”</p>

</div>

<p>Upon the whole, this speech was a wonderful
performance for a man in his seventieth year.
Mr. Cobbett had far too often relied upon h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>is own
powers in legal defence; yet his failures as an
advocate were failures which any member of the
bar might have been proud of. And, in the present
case, the charge of sedition was so utterly
base and trumpery, that the cause of the prosecution
really gave power to his own, by furnishing
him with a handle for the bitterest expressions of
contempt. He certainly lashed into the Whigs
most unmercifully, from time to time; as opportunity
brought them again to his mind. For
example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The noble marquis (Blandford) informed me in a
letter, that it had been currently reported in the House
of Commons and the Club Houses, that I had been connected
with some of the fires and had run away! Run
away, indeed! Who was I to run from? What!
I run from the Greys, the Lambs, the Russells, and the
Broughams? I! Gentlemen, contempt comes to my
aid, or I should suffocate with indignation at the thought!
No, I have not run away; that base faction has brought
me here, and I thank them for it; because it enables me
to clear myself from the false and scandalous calumnies
which they have been circulating against me.”</p>

</div>

<p>And, having reviewed the whole charge, and its
collaterals, Mr. Cobbett wound up his address as
follows&mdash;in terms which form a strikingly truthful
sketch, not only of the position in which he then
stood, but of the position which he occupies (with
all his faults) in the hearts and minds of his fe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>llow-countrymen&mdash;a
brave, earnest, upright, and patriotic
man.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The fact is, that I am the watchman, the man on
the tower, who can be neither coaxed, nor wheedled, nor
bullied; and I have expressed my determination never
to quit my post until I obtain a cheap government for
the country, and by doing away with places and pensions,
prevent the people’s pockets from being picked. These
men know that if I were to get into the House of
Commons under a reformed parliament, I should speedily
effect that object, and therefore they are resolved to get
rid of me by some means or other; but, thank God,
gentlemen, you will not let them effect it on the present
occasion.</p>

<p>“I have little else to add, except to state what evidence
I shall lay before you. The first witness I shall call will
be the Lord Chancellor, and I will put in the letter to
the Luddites, and which by delivery to Lord Brougham
for publication, I, in point of law, republished at the
very time when I was said to be endeavouring to stir up
the labourers to sedition and outrage. I will then call
his Lordship to prove the fact respecting the application
for it, and he will tell you that I stipulated no terms,
but that the whole of the letter should be published. I
shall then call the Earl of Radnor, who knows me and
all my sentiments well, and he will tell you whether I am
a likely man to design and endeavour to do that which
this ‘false, scandalous, and malicious’ Whig indictment
charges me with wishing to do. I shall also call several
persons of the highest respectability from Kent, Sussex,
and other parts of the country, to prove that I have not
done anything to stir up disturbance, but that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
done a great deal to prevent it and to restore quiet. I
shall then call Lord Melbourne to prove that the sentence
on Goodman was not executed, but that he was sent out
of the country, whereas Cook was put to death. When
the jury shall have heard all this, and shall have read
over the various publications, I have not the slightest
doubt but that they will dismiss with scorn and contempt
this groundless charge of the Whig Attorney-General.
This is the second time in my life that I have been prosecuted
by an Attorney-General, and brought before this
court. I have been writing for thirty years, and only
twice out of that long period have I been brought before
this court. The first time was by an apostate Whig.
What, indeed, of evil have the Whigs not done? Since
then, although there have been six Attorneys-General, all
Tories, and although, were I a crown lawyer, I might
pick out plenty of libels from my writings, if this be a
libel, yet I have never for twenty-one years been prosecuted
until this Whig government came in. But the
Whigs were always a most tyrannical faction; they
always tried to make tyranny double tyranny; they were
always the most severe, the most grasping, the most
greedy, the most tyrannical faction whose proceedings
are recorded in history. It was they who seized what remained
of the Crown lands; it was they who took to
themselves the last portion of Church property; it was
they who passed the monstrous Riot Act; it was they
also who passed the Septennial Bill. The Government
are now acquiring great credit for doing away with the
rotten boroughs; but if they deserve credit for doing
them away, let it be borne in mind that the Whigs
created them. They established an interest in the regulation,
and gave consistency and value to corruption.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Then came the excise laws, which were brought in by
the Whigs; and from them, too, emanated that offensive
statute by which Irish men and Irish women may be
transported without judge or jury. There is, indeed, no
faction so severe and cruel; they do everything by force
and violence: the Whigs are the Rehoboam of England;
the Tories ruled us with rods, but the Whigs scourge us
with scorpions!</p>

<p>The last time I was brought before this court, I was
sent out of it to two years’ imprisonment among felons,
and was condemned to pay, at the expiration of the two
years, a fine of 1000<i>l.</i> to the King, which the King took
and kept. But this was not all; I was bound, too, in a
penalty of 5000<i>l.</i> myself, and obliged to procure two
sureties in 2500<i>l.</i> each, to keep the peace for seven years.…
I was carried seventy miles from my family, and
shut up in a jail, doubtless with the hope that I should
expire from stench and mortification of mind. It pleased
God, however, to bless me with health, and, though deprived
of liberty, by dint of sobriety and temperance, I
outlived the base attempt to destroy me. What crime
had I committed? For what was it that I was condemned
to this horrible punishment? Simply for writing
a paragraph in which I expressed the indignation I felt
at an English local militiaman having been flogged under
a guard of German bayonets! I only expressed the indignation
I felt, and I should have been a base creature
indeed, if I had not expressed it. But now, military
flogging excites universal indignation. If there be at
present any of the jury alive who found me guilty and
sentenced me to that punishment, what remorse must
they not feel for their conduct when they perceive that
every writer in every periodical of the present da<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>y, even
including the favourite publication of the Whig Attorney-General,
are now unanimous in deprecating the system
of military flogging altogether! Yes, for expressing my
disapprobation of that system, I was tossed into a
dungeon like Daniel into the lions’ den. But why am I
now tossed down before this court by the Attorney-General?
What are my sins? I have called on the
Government to respect the law; I have cautioned them
that hard-hearted proceedings are driving the labourers
to despair; that is my crime. If the Government
really wish to avoid disturbances in the country, let
them give us back the old laws; let them give
the people the old game law, and repeal the new
law; and let them do away with the other grinding
laws that oppress the poor. I have read with horror
which I cannot describe, of a magistrate being accused
to the Lord Chancellor of subornation of perjury;
I have read of that magistrate being reinstated, and I
have shuddered with horror at supposing that a poor
starving labourer may be brought before such a man, and
in conjunction with another such magistrate, may be
doomed to seven years’ transportation for being out at
night, and such a magistrate may be himself a game-preserver!
This is a monstrous power, and certainly ought
to be abolished. The ministry, however, will perhaps
adopt the measures I have recommended, and then
prosecute me for recommending them. Just so it is with
parliamentary reform, a measure which I have been foremost
in recommending for twenty years. I have pointed
out and insisted upon, the sort of reform that we must
have; and they are compelled already to adopt a large
part of my suggestions, and avowedly against their will.
They hate me for this; they look upon it as I do, tha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>t
they are married to Reform, and that I am the man who
has furnished the halter in which they are led to church.
For supplying that halter they have made this attack
on me through the Attorney-General, and will slay me if
they can. The Whigs know that my intention was not
bad. This is a mere pretence to inflict pecuniary ruin
on me, or cause me to die of sickness in a jail; so that
they may get rid of me, because they can neither buy nor
silence me. It is their fears which make them attack
me, and it is my death they intend. In that object
they will be defeated; for, thank heaven, you stand
between me and destruction. If, however, your verdict
should be&mdash;which I do not anticipate&mdash;one that will consign
me to death, by sending me to a loathsome dungeon,
I will with my last breath pray to God to bless my
country and curse the Whigs; and I bequeath my revenge
to my children and the labourers of England.”</p>

</div>

<p>The result of this trial was hailed with great
satisfaction by nearly all the newspapers. And
the chief significance of the episode lies in this:
that from that month of July, 1831, the press of this
kingdom has been free from political persecution.
There can be no doubt whatever, that this trial
settled the question as to whether the press was to
be gagged or not. The newspapers were good
enough to admit so much.</p>

“antidote” to the writings of men who had “no regard for <i>you</i>,
they want <i>rebellion</i>,” &amp;c., &amp;c. Here is a bit of Mr. Day’s logic:&mdash;“Cobbett
positively asserts that he everywhere did his best to put a

the farmers to call the people together in their several parishes, to
explain the matter to them, and to call upon them all to join in a
petition to Parliament for a reduction of taxes and tithes! Now,
who is there, even among the poor, that cannot see what all this
means? It amounts to this: let the employer make common cause
with the employed, and go hand in hand in denouncing the Government
of the country, and the clergy of the Church of England, and

Mr. Seeley, the well-known bookseller, a bitter opponent of Cobbett’s,
was on the jury; but the foreman, a Mr. Wilkinson, was a
vigorous Cobbettite; and these two led the parties in the struggle.
Cobbett begged his friend to attend him in court, for then “he
should have confidence.” As a matter of fact, Denman’s insinuation
about a mob was utterly baseless, for Cobbett only had two or
three friends with him. The people waited in court all night, and
the cheering and uproar were tremendous when the result was
announced.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">“I NOW BELONG TO THE PEOPLE OF OLDHAM.”</span></h2>

<p>The progress of the Reform Bill is the foremost
topic of the day; and the near prospect of Mr.
Cobbett’s election, by some popular constituency,
is now more obvious.<a name="FNanchor_1_108" id="FNanchor_1_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_108" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In the course of September,
1831, there appears his first address to the electors
of Manchester, in response to an invitation conveyed
to him from a committee formed with the
object of endeavouring to secure his return.</p>

<p>The objects which Cobbett now professed to
have in view were considerably in advance of those
of some years previously; and their publication, in
this address, shows distinctly the rapid growth of
opinion amongst the mass of the people. Not
only the abolition of sinecures, and of all pensions
the merit of which could not be readily granted;
abolition of tithes; reduction of the standing army;
and an equitable adjustment of the currency, were
recapitulated, as reforms urgently called for; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
he now declared that the National Debt ought to
be wiped out, by the sale of ecclesiastical estates,
the misapplied portion of the property of corporate
bodies, and all the Crown lands; and so to reduce
taxation, and the cost of its collection, as to give
some hopes of greater prosperity and happiness to
“this industrious nation.”</p>

<p>Of course, these things were “revolutionary”
for that age. Every great change is revolutionary;
but the bad odour attaching to an epithet, in some
minds, is no index to the value of the ideas represented.
Important changes in the mode of government,
particularly as to a greatly-lessened waste of
public money, naturally appeared monstrous and
wicked to the governing classes, and to their
adherents; at a period when bishops died worth
half-a-million. And it came just as naturally to
the minds of the reformers, the longer the question
was delayed, that, by whatever name their proposals
might be designated, there could be nothing
so monstrous and wicked as to persist in a system
which made the rich richer and the poor poorer.</p>

<p>The events of the past fifteen years had made a
wonderful difference in the minds of the labouring
classes. The power of a cheap serial, first exemplified
in the publication of Cobbett’s twopenny <i>Register</i>,
had become fully recognized. The <i>Penny Magazine</i>,
<i>Chambers’ Edinburgh Journal</i>, and similar
publications were now beginning their respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
careers with astonishing success; along with a
host of political sheets. A new sort of education
was spreading: that sort of education which made
men think for themselves; and, for the first time
in history, the “lower orders” were beginning to
take an interest in the affairs of other nations
beside their own. Well might statesmen be
affrighted at the progress of revolution in France
and Belgium, and at the growing importance of
the American Republic! The knowledge of
political good and evil, fresh from those democratic
sources, might well alarm them; for it was
sinking deep into minds, the fertility of which had
been produced by their own haughty failures.</p>

<p>So Mr. Cobbett’s address to the electors of
Manchester was denounced as utterly subversive
of the institutions of the country. However, he
went down to Manchester in the course of the
winter, and delivered several lectures, with the
object of showing that his principles, on the contrary,
would tend to conserve, instead of destroy.
Lord Radnor had previously written a letter to one
of the Manchester papers<a name="FNanchor_2_109" id="FNanchor_2_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_109" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> warmly supporting him,
and offering his aid, in case of a subscription being
made. And Cobbett now found, upon visiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Manchester, that he had already won his way into
the hearts and minds of the people there. Before
he left, a dinner was given in his honour, at which
Mr. John Fielden, manufacturer, of Todmorden,
presided.</p>

<p>The following will give an example of his
general reception in Lancashire. Most of Cobbett’s
“egotism” was displayed in answer to personal
attacks, and we owe a good deal of biographical
matter to those occasions on which he chose to
answer. One evening in the House of Lords,
the Earl of Falmouth, in passing a sneer over to
Lord Radnor, concerning the latter’s nomination-borough
of Downton, insinuated that the loss of
that borough would be “a bad thing for Cobbett,
whom the people would scarcely elect, if left to
themselves.” Lord Falmouth had a taste of
Mr. Cobbett’s lash, as a reward for his temerity;
and Cobbett concluded his paper thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have been lecturing on politics&mdash;I have been
maintaining my <i>Manchester propositions</i>, in every great
town in the north, as far as the northern confines of
Yorkshire, with the exception, I believe, of Liverpool
and Bradford; and I have everywhere maintained that,
unless those propositions be acted upon to the full
extent, a reform of the Parliament will be a delusion
and a mockery. Everywhere I have been received with
every mark of approbation.… Two or three
words with my name, written by myself, have been
begged as a valuable present by more than a hundred
persons. No mark of disapprobation have I received
during the whole of half-a-hundred lectures that I have
given.… The people of England will have the
sense to perceive that it is not title and fortune that they
want to represent them; but talent, knowledge, and
courage; a love of the honour of their country; men
who see in every labourer their countryman, and who
take to themselves a share of the disgrace of seeing him
robbed of the fruit of his toil. Experience has now
taught the people of England that, to be restored to
their liberties and happiness, they must rely upon one
another; and though you do not know it, the country
everywhere teems with clever and well-educated young
men. During my last tour, scores&mdash;and I might say
many hundreds of young men, sometimes twenty at a
time&mdash;have crowded round me as I have been going out
of the lecturing-places; one saying, as he shook my
hand, ‘That is the hand that wrote the “Grammar;”’
another, ‘That is the hand that wrote the “Protestant
Reformation;”’ another, ‘That is the hand that wrote
the “Advice to Young Men.”’ This was the case, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
or less, at every place where I was.… Nor was this
confined to the buoyant spirits of Lancashire and Yorkshire,
where the heart seems always upon the lips; but
I found it the same everywhere.”</p>

</div>

<p>The month of June saw the triumph of the
Parliamentary Reformers, and eager preparations
were made for canvass. Expectation ran high:
the newly-enfranchised took the matter into their
own hands; and amongst these were the people of
Lancashire. Manchester had sent a member to
Parliament in some long past age, but had been
for centuries unrepresented, and was now to have
two members. Oldham, with a population of over
50,000, was, likewise, to elect two.</p>

<p>Early in July, 1832, Mr. Cobbett received a letter
from an Oldham friend, informing him that it was
determined to put him in nomination; and that
two strangers having unexpectedly commenced a
canvass, his friends had at once announced his
name, along with that of Mr. John Fielden; the
latter having consented to the proposal, with the
understanding that Cobbett should be his colleague,
if not elected for some other place. Several
other constituencies had been thought of; but this
unmistakable earnestness on the part of Lancashire
decided the matter; and when, in the course
of December, the elections came off, Fielden and
Cobbett were at the top of the poll for Oldham.
The people of Manchester had also put Mr. Cobbet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>t
in nomination, but, the result of the contest
at Oldham being made known there on the first
day of the poll, the votes intended for him were
transferred to other candidates.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another lecturing tour had been
undertaken during the autumn, extending into
Scotland; and, if one may judge from the reception
he met with, Mr. Cobbett was now enjoying
greater popularity than at any other period of his
life.<a name="FNanchor_3_110" id="FNanchor_3_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_110" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The noti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>ons which Mr. Cobbett had acquired,
concerning the duties belonging to the position in
which he was now placed, were quite at variance
with any known principles.</p>

<p>Until the æra of the Reformed Parliament it was
accounted a preposterous thing for any member
to be professedly without a party; and any one
entering the House with a popular grievance at his
back, as Paull and Burdett and Wardle had done
in a previous generation&mdash;and as O’Connell and
Hume in recent times&mdash;to a great extent stood
alone. They might get supporters from time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
time; but such men were not of the sort which
could coalesce with the patrician nominees and
the plutocrats, who had hitherto pretended to
represent the Commons of England.</p>

<p>Had Mr. Cobbett entered Parliament a quarter
of a century previously, when it was within his
power to do so through aristocratic influence, he
would have been the means of forming a party
earnestly devoted to the objects of Reform; and
it must be regarded as a serious error on his part,
arising though it did from a sturdy regard for his
own independence, that he should refuse to do so;
and expect to sway the House of Commons, in the
smallest degree, from the outside. For it was
looked upon, in those days, as something bordering
on the seditious, for any one outside the walls
of Parliament to pretend to discuss domestic
politics; and an affectation of contempt was the
only answer to the cleverest and most liberal of
amateur statesmanship. As for earnestness, in the
consideration of any popular question, it was not
there at all; the House of Commons of 1831-2
would never have passed a Reform Bill, only that
the clamour of the Unrepresented made the question
vital to the existence of the Whig party; and
the fiercest opponents to the popular candidates,
at the elections which followed, were the ministerialists
themselves. To the very last the spectacle
was seen of the exclusive classes clinging to what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
they deemed a prescriptive right to govern.</p>

<p>Such men, then, as Cobbett, and Silk Buckingham,
and Roebuck, coming into Parliament for
the first time, found themselves there under circumstances
favourable only for the exercise of
particular individuality; and, unless the possessor
of special talents, the event proved that the individual
influence of each was very small. The old
members would not even listen to them; and the
general feeling concerning the new men was that
they were astonishingly harmless.</p>

<p>The opening scene has been often enough described.
“Some very bad characters have been
returned,” says Mr. Greville.<a name="FNanchor_4_111" id="FNanchor_4_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_111" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Among these “bad
characters” is placed the new member for Oldham;
who at once establishes his claim to such epithet,
by seating himself on the front bench (usually
occupied by ministers), and by commencing his
first speech with these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It appears to me, that, since I have been sitting
here, I have heard a great deal of vain and unprofitable
conversation.”</p>

</div>

<p>But, really, there was nothing to be frightened
at. Excepting that Mr. Cobbett seemed to think
that a Reformer should be chosen Speaker of a Reformed
Parliament, and that some disregard might
be paid to the established rules of the House, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
was nothing whatever to reward the expectations
of those who had trembled at the bare thought of
this “diabolical villain” treading the floor of that
sacred chamber. There sat, night after night, one
of the meekest, most inoffensive of men. When
he got up to speak, there stood a fine, tall, hale old
fellow, with a face sparkling with humour, and a
voice of surprising gentleness; only roused to
vehemence when the efforts to cough him down
were somewhat too overpowering.</p>

<p>Cobbett’s short career in Parliament has, sometimes,
been stigmatized as a failure. It was not
a failure. He was a very regular attendant while
his health lasted; and he never lost an opportunity
of reminding the House what he had been sent
there for. And the numerous interruptions and
contradictions to which he at first became subject,
rather manifested “failure” elsewhere: viz. on the
part of many members to understand the awful
exigencies of the time, and the responsibility which
they ought to have attached to their own position.
But their sensibilities were far too keen, to bear
with patience Mr. Cobbett’s frequent references to
the burdens under which the people still laboured;
one member, at last, expressing an opinion that
“the constant complaints respecting the distresses
of the people were of the most injurious tendency:
they were calculated to make all classes politicians”!
In short, the first reformed Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
was, itself, a great failure; and was rightly sent
back to the country at the end of two unproductive
sessions.</p>

<p>It must be said, however, that the first two or
three months of Mr. Cobbett’s attendance in Parliament
were not calculated to impress the House in
his favour. Although he put up with malicious
references to Tom Paine, and to agricultural incendiarism,
with remarkable good temper, there
was an amount of indiscretion about his mode
of bringing up his own special topics, which
mightily offended the taste of less self-assertive
people. And, upon one occasion, his mode of
procedure was so absurd, that he covered both
himself and his cause with overwhelming contempt.
The circumstances were these:&mdash;</p>

<p>A number of gentlemen, led by Mr. Attwood,
the member for Birmingham, conceived it to be
only just and proper that an inquiry should be
made into the state of the country, and the prevailing
distress.<a name="FNanchor_5_112" id="FNanchor_5_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_112" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Lord Althorp considered any
such inquiry unadvisable, “because it might lead
to an investigation of the consequences produced
by the changes in the currency;”&mdash;he was willing
to consider the subject when it came fairly before
the House, but objected to the proposed mode
of entertaining it. The motion was lost, by a
narrow majority; and it was renewed, about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
month afterwards, in another form, only to fail
again. Thus, the Whig ministry set their faces
against the very Reformers which they had themselves
called up.</p>

<p>But Mr. Cobbett wants, above all things, the
very thing that Lord Althorp deprecates: “an
investigation of the consequences produced by the
changes in the currency,” and he is resolved to
have it, one way or another. And he can think
of no surer means than that of fixing the <i>onus</i> of
the public distresses upon the author of those
changes in the currency, which he had always
considered to be a leading cause of the distress.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Peel was, at this time, leader of the
opposition, and the most distinguished man on the
Tory side,&mdash;admired alike by friend and foe. The
hopes of the Tory party were centred in Peel, for
no man who had pretended to lead them, since the
days of Pitt, could boast a tenth part of the talents
which he possessed. His first important part in
public affairs had been the carrying through Parliament,
in 1819, the bill for the resumption of cash
payments; a measure which Mr. Cobbett had treated
with ridicule, as one certain to be productive of
prolonged disaster to the country. Cobbett’s predictions
were, to a great extent, verified by events;
and he considered himself, thenceforward, an
authority upon that abstruse topic. And he now
brought forward a resolution, to the effect <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>that
Peel’s “want of knowledge,” displayed in his repeated
failures to adjust the currency, since the
year 1819, merited his ignominious dismissal from
the Privy Council.</p>

<p>No scheme could have been invented, better
than this, in order to show Cobbett’s headstrong
ineptitude on certain occasions. To go no farther,&mdash;the
inconsistency of protesting that there was no
imputation on Peel’s honour, while proposing what
would have been (for him) the very deepest disgrace,
was typical of much that explains Cobbett’s frequent
failure to impress men of cultivation and
refinement; and he gave, in this instance, a signal
example of his neglect to consider the fitness of
things. Most of what he said was perfectly true,
and could not be answered, and was not answered;
but the outrageous method of bringing the question
forward not only spoilt it all, but brought down
upon his head deserved derision. Fielden, and
Attwood, and three others, manfully supported
him; while the rest laughed and jeered, to their
heart’s content.</p>

<p>It was nearly a month after this episode, before
Cobbett’s voice was again heard. At length, however,
he seems to have learned the temper of the
House; and we soon find him thanking “hon.
members for the attention with which, &amp;c.” He
generally had something to say upon any topic
connected with taxation and the well-being of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span> the
people, and on several occasions delivered long
and effective speeches; as on the Poor Laws, suppression
of disturbances in Ireland, and the proposed
Factory regulations. On this last question
Mr. Fielden was in the front rank as an agitator;
and was intensely gratified with the support of his
colleague, especially when Cobbett, speaking of
the factory children, alluded to “three hundred
thousand of the most helpless creatures in the
world holding up their hands for mercy.” And one
matter appears on the journals of the House, upon
Mr. Cobbett’s motion, which resulted in a Select
Committee.<a name="FNanchor_6_113" id="FNanchor_6_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_113" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In the spring of the following year, ominous
signs appeared, which proved that the change in
his habits, necessitated by his parliamentary attendance,
was telling upon Cobbett’s vigorous
constitution; and he was absent from his post for
two whole months. The period which elapsed
after the dissolution, and before the meeting of the
new Parliament in 1835, was not sufficient for
thorough restoration to health, and he resumed
his duties with a bad cough clinging to him. O<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>n
the 10th of March, he attempted to speak upon
the motion of the Marquess of Chandos to abolish
the malt-tax; but he found his voice so hoarse,
that he could not make the gentlemen immediately
in front hear him; and was obliged to sit down.
He still valiantly attended, however, and spoke
on several occasions; the last being on the 25th
May, in a discussion on agricultural distress.</p>

<p>But his time was come: his place in the House
of Commons knew him no more; and, when the
House assembled on the evening of the 19th June,
a whisper circulated upon the benches to the effect
that the member for Oldham was dead.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_110" id="Footnote_3_110"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_110"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Tait’s <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> (Nov. 1832) describes Cobbett’s
reception in Edinburgh in very generous terms, declaring that Pasta,
Paganini, nor Fanny Kemble created half such sensation. “He
presented himself before an impatient house, filled from floor to
ceiling, which rose to greet him in a tumultuous rapture. His
appearance is highly favourable; his ease, tact, and self-possession
are unrivaled. He was neither overpowered nor taken by surprise
with these demonstrations of the modern Athenians.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Cobbett is still of stately stature, and must in youth have
been tall. He must then, in physiognomy, person, and bearing,
have been a fine specimen of the true Saxon breed;&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The eyes of azure, and the locks of brown,</div>
<div class="verse">And the blunt speech, that bursts without a pause,</div>
<div class="verse">And free-born thoughts, which league the soldier with the laws.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>… His thin, white hairs and high forehead, the humour
lurking in the eye, and playing about the lips, betokened something
more than the squire in his gala suit; still, the altogether was
of this respectable and responsible kind. His voice is low-toned,
clear, and flexible, and so skilfully modulated, that not an aspiration
was lost of his nervous, fluent, unhesitating, and perfectly correct
discourse. There was no embarrassment, no flutter, no picking of
words; nor was the speaker once at fault, or in the smallest degree
disturbed, by those petty accidents and annoyances which must have
moved almost any other man.… He is, indeed, a first-rate comic
actor, possessed of that flexible, penetrative power of imitation
which extends to mind and character, as well as to their outward
signs. His genius is, besides, essentially dramatic. We have often
read his lively characteristic dialogues with pleasure and amusement,
but to see him act them, and personate Lord Althorp, pommelled
and posed by the future Member for Oldham, was a degree beyond
this. He was in nothing vehement or obstreperous, though everybody
had anticipated something of this kind; and his subdued tone
and excellent discretion gave double point to his best hits.…
The humour of his solemn irony, his blistering sarcasm, but
especially his sly hits and unexpected or random strokes and pokes
on the sore or weak sides of the Whigs, told with full effect. To
oratory, in the highest sense of the term, Mr. Cobbett never once
rises, but he is ever a wily, clear, and most effective speaker.”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Cobbett expressed himself highly gratified with his reception
in Edinburgh. In Glasgow, and other parts of the country, he
has been, if that were possible, still more popular. And at this we
rejoice, as evidence of affection for the cause to which, whatever
fastidious persons may think, Cobbett has been a useful, rough
pioneer, and most powerful auxiliary.”
</p>
<p>
The Rev. George Gilfillan gives (“Gallery of Literary Portraits,”
2nd Ser.) an animated account of Cobbett’s appearance in Edinburgh,
and is very fair, albeit shrewd enough, in his entire estimate of
Cobbett’s character.</p>

been acting the part of an amateur spy, by joining several political

produced great excitement at the time; and Popay was, in consequence

PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.”<a name="FNanchor_1_114" id="FNanchor_1_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_114" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></h2>

<p>So this long fight was over.</p>

<p>For forty years past, Cobbett had waged incessant
warfare against political hypocrisy and corruption;
here represented by revolutionary theorists;
there by political adventures; now, by venal
courtiers; again, by uncompromising partisanship
in the press. Heedless of personal danger, and
proud of his native soil and of his fellow-countrymen,
he had never flinched from the pursuit of those
whom he regarded as the enemies of his country’s
welfare. Often blindly passionate, but always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
honest, and dominated by the convictions of the
hour, he had presented the unexampled phenomenon
of a man who could face, single-handed, the world
in arms; insusceptible alike to the arts of intrigue,
and to the cozening of partisanship.</p>

<p>The character of the London newspaper press, in
the earlier years of the present century, bears no
comparison with its now-existing posterity, either
in character, ability, or influence. Our leading
journal, indeed, should scarcely know its own grandfather:
appealing, as it does, to the taste of the
most highly-cultivated minds of the age; and quite
indifferent to anything but the task of representing
the best public opinion of the day. As for a
“government organ,” there is no such thing; your
newspaper now gets upon the wings of the day, or
what it supposes the wings of the day, and there
catches the best breeze that it can. There is no
space for mutual recriminations, with ostentation of
“private wire,” and elaborate political and literary
reviews, if even the taste for dirt-throwing had not
vanished. The doctrine of the survival of the fittest
is found to hold good, in journalism as in everything
else; and there cannot, possibly, be any
better token of the improvement of the age, in taste
and morals, than the elevated tone of the more successful
leaders of public opinion in our own days.</p>

<p>When the History of the newspaper-press co<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>mes
to be properly written, it will not be a mere record
of the struggles and strifes of proprietors; the successes
of the few, and the failures of the many; nor
even the extraordinary wealth of anecdote furnished
by personal history. Along with these matters will
have to be introduced critical studies, derived from
close examination of the journals; discovering the
amount of prescience with which each may be
credited, and the growth and decay of their influence;
tracing motives of particular partisanship to
their source; and estimating their relative places,
in the grand temple of the Fourth Estate.</p>

<p>The task of that historian will find its best reward,
in the endeavour to comprehend the first quarter of
the nineteenth century. He will see the press first
enslaved, then reckless, then persecuted; then
partially enslaved again; then gradually presenting
a prospect that it will, one day or other, become
purified into something like dignity and respectability.
For all this long while, it has been strangely
unable to endure rivalry and opposition; and its
members have vied with one another, as to which
could employ the foulest epithets, impute the
wickedest motives to opponents, or fawn the most
gracefully upon “patrons.” There was no place for
independence, in those days; for independent principles
were considered to hide the wolf of Jacobinism.
The alteration in tone, consequent upon a change
of proprietorship, went under the favourite stigma
of “profligacy.”<a name="FNanchor_2_115" id="FNanchor_2_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_115" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> As for party-spirit, there n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>ever
was a truer dictum than that laid down by Mr.
Cobbett, in one of the later numbers of the London
<i>Porcupine</i>: “The press is as much shackled and
restrained by the spirit of party, as it could be by
the most restrictive laws.”</p>

<p>From the day of the first appearance of the
<i>Political Register</i>, a new æra dawned for journalism.
Its originality in plan, and the power with
which it was written, awakened envy; its plain
English, and rapid acquisition of independence in
opinion, provoked opposition. And the success,
with which its early career was marked, brought
imitators into the field. But that which soon
characterized it, more particularly, was an inflexible
hostility to such newspapers, and such persons, who
endeavoured to extenuate or explain away the misuse
of public money. People sadly wanted educating
upon this point. The principles of Walpole
and Newcastle had borne fruit. The Treasury was
surrounded by hungry adventurers; and there
were hundreds of men, as late as William Pitt’s
time, who had sucked-in these principles, as it were,
with their mothers’ milk. And if we consider that,
when Cobbett began the fight, and for some time
after, there was no one else had the courage, or w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>as
in the mind, to expose it all, we shall understand
the singular position in which he stood. For an
anonymous writer to sit down, and write off a
malicious paragraph or two with insinuations of
venality, was one thing; but, for a man, well-known
in the flesh, renouncing the editorial “we,” and
affecting the first-person-singular, proceeding to
tell a plain story, fearless of the consequences, was
a phenomenon which startled Society; the effect
produced being similar to that which occurs upon
poking your walking-stick into an ants’ nest.</p>

<p>Decent Society never forgave Mr. Cobbett. No
matter! Upon that man’s memory lies the credit
of having been chiefly instrumental in restoring
political purity to the nation. The whole domestic
history of England, between 1800 and 1835, is distinguished
by the struggles of the nation to emancipate
itself from corruption in Church and State.
The pioneer was William Cobbett; and no history
of those struggles, which does not place him high
among the “leaders and guiders” of men, will be
worthy of the name.</p>

<p>As to how far Mr. Cobbett’s ideas and predictions
have been accepted, is not the purpose of the
present work; if, even, its limits did not forbid such
an essay. It is certain that he was largely pirated,
during his lifetime, both in speeches and in newspaper
articles. But he lost so much weight, in the
minds of dispassionate men, by such unbounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
extravagance as was displayed in his “History of the
Reformation;” and his cotemporaries were so
cruelly lashed and scolded, when the advocacy of
their own views exceeded the truth, that the significance
of his career could not be properly understood
by his generation. It is almost surprising
that more bad institutions did not fall before his
trenchant blows; yet, with respect to those that
remain,<a name="FNanchor_3_116" id="FNanchor_3_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_116" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and are doomed, it may safely be recommended
to ransack the <i>Political Register</i> for the
best arguments and illustrations, with which to
defy their supporters. On many great questions
Cobbett was far in advance of his time; perhaps on
nothing more so than in the foresight with which
he contemplated the development of popular ideas.
To us, in Liberal-Conservative times, the following
passage (May, 1833) seems a commonplace; but, to
the privileged classes of his own days, the words
were as the words of Micaiah in the ears of
Ahab:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is not by harshly and rudely resisting the claims of
the people, that you put a stop to the progress of democracy.
It is by yielding in time; by yielding to what is
manifestly just in the people’s demands; by removing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
expenses so clearly unjust towards the people, and so
clearly unnecessary to the support of good and efficient
government; it is by taking from their backs burdens
which they cannot bear without ruin; and which they
ought not to bear at all. It is by means like these; by
doing these things, which satisfy all reasonable men, and
putting them on your side; it is by these that you check,
and put a stop to, the progress of democracy; and not
by acts which plainly tell the people that they are to
expect no redress of their grievances as long as the present
order of things shall exist.”</p>

</div>

<p>The grave was literally his last enemy. The
announcement of Cobbett’s death was the close of
a strife, in which had been displayed the singular
spectacle of the Champion of the Press arrayed
against its own licentiousness; in which the dangers
attendant upon the conjuring up of new foes
had been counted as nothing, while there was a
principle to be maintained, or a touch of cant to
be exposed. And, now that he was gone for ever,
the whole fraternity acknowledged his genius and
his talents; and confessed that a good, and great,
and honest heart had departed from among them.
Throughout the land, with almost unanimity, the
newspapers teemed with his praises; and those
were not few, who, having not long since boasted
of their hatred, now frankly declared that Mr.
Cobbett was a man of whom his countrymen might
justly be proud, as one of the greatest that England
had ever produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The last years of Mr. Cobbett’s domestic life were
of singular tranquillity. Surrounded as he was by a
family, the individual members of which had “never
caused him a day’s anxiety,” his hearth was a
complete antithesis to the stormy scenes outside.
And he had that felicity, the first wish of every
good man’s heart, of seeing his sons and daughters
bear the fruits of his own example, in a correct
estimate of the duties and the discipline of life.
Not only that. Age never came upon him in
crabbed form. There was a soft, genial nature
about Mr. Cobbett, which no surface vehemence
could exorcise. Even, when dealing his heaviest
blows upon the heads of the poor “borough-mongers,”
or when pouring his most terrible sarcasms
around, his energy was the energy of
warmth; as though heated with his own heart’s
blood. It would be difficult to find any one essay
among his writings, which, fairly analyzed, did not
betray honest, impetuous affection for the cause
immediately on hand. You cannot fail, as you
read, to recognize the unpaid advocate. That he
was ridiculously vain of his success in life, is no more
than could be expected of a half-educated man, who
had held, for more than a generation, such extraordinary
power with the lower and middle classes;
but such vanity, fostered sometimes by individuals
and sometimes by the crowd, was not of that sort
typified by the Napoleons and the Masaniellos of l<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>ife.
No: the sword laid down, and the helm removed
from the brow, left this warrior a homely citizen,
resting with the children, and the birds, the fruits
and flowers, and the sweetest hospitalities.</p>

<p>So, old age brought nothing to Mr. Cobbett, of
the burthen. “Always at work or sleep,” the work
he did at seventy years of age was not excelled in
quality by that of any previous period of his life;
and, had it not been for the enforced change of
habits brought about by his attendance in parliament,
he might have lived another decade or so.
He had, even, inured himself to noisy Fleet Street.
Speaking, somewhere, of his upper room in Bolt
Court, he says,&mdash;</p>

<p>“The birds sing better, and sing louder, and
more, and stronger in a cage, than they do when
at large;” adding that “the best pastorals have
been written in smoky garrets.” Naturally enough,
if a man hath a garden in his own heart.</p>

<p>But, in truth, much of Cobbett’s wonderful staying-power
lay in his splendid mental and physical
health. An active and temperate existence, in which
nothing was allowed to run to waste, warded-off the
approaches of senility. Excepting only a tumour
which gave some trouble for a few months<a name="FNanchor_4_117" id="FNanchor_4_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_117" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> during
1824, he had known nothing of illness; beyond
those trifling matters to which even the best cons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>titutions
are liable under given circumstances.
After reaching his threescore-and-ten, he could still
boast of riding over the country with the youngest;
or doing a day’s work against any one of his
labourers.</p>

<p>This was an astonishingly active, fully-worked
life; in which nothing of the morbid could possibly
find entrance. An early riser, and no lingerer at
meals, Cobbett never confessed to having any
leisure time. Social pleasures, as such, would seem
to have been almost unheeded, if not despised.
Yet his hospitality was unbounded, and overflowing
with good nature; and he was always at the
service of persons who applied to him for advice, or,
even, of those nondescript individuals who would
claim the privileges of half-acquaintanceship, and
call upon him to indulge a sort of curiosity.</p>

<p>And, of all this vigour, and heartiness, and true
daily purpose, nothing failed, in the green old age
of William Cobbett.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Very difficult as it is to point to a date, at which
Cobbett’s name will be forgotten&mdash;it is easy to
understand why the popular estimate of the man, at
the period of his death, still holds good, in the
Anglo-Saxon breast: why his character, falling so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
far short of perfection, is still counted worthy of the
lasting honour of Englishmen. For, his faults were
the faults of his race: so often virtues in disguise.
Coming from the pure Saxon peasant stock, he
caused a healthful infusion of fresh blood into the
spirit of his age, and so brought his fellow-countrymen
to see, once more, the native energy, and
pugnacity, and honesty of purpose, which had so
often won the battle of freedom, now brought to
bear upon new conditions and new circumstances.
Thus it is, that the thoughtful and unbiased student
looks upon Cobbett’s character and career. Full of
faults, it is no incoherent jumble of a character,
without principles and without light; but one
having brave and high aims. A special lot in life;
which must, by its very nature, bring upon the man
some measure of contumely: in which a false step
or two would count against him a thousandfold. A
special career; pursued with a single eye, an honest
purpose, and a persevering heart. A life, that needs
no Apologist: but presenting a consistent story;
worthy of all that has given us renown, and enabled
us to dictate the principles of freedom to the whole
world.</p>

<p>The last uneventful years of Mr. Cobbett’s
domestic life were spent, at least as far as the public
demands upon his time would allow, among the
scenes and the occupations which he loved so well:
those of his earliest recollections. The gar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>den at
Kensington becoming too small for his ambitious
seed-farming experiments, the well-known manor-farm
of Barn Elm was occupied for three or four
years. But, in the summer of 1832, this was
relinquished; and Mr. Cobbett retired farther
into Surrey, to a locality not many miles from
his birthplace, in the adjoining parish of Ash.
Normandy farm (contiguous to that of Wanborough,
whence Mr. Birkbeck had departed for the
golden west) lies in a lonely, unfrequented district,
with a poor, wet soil; and it was one that required
a great deal of money expended upon it. But it
suited Cobbett’s seed-farming tastes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I took a farm,” he says, in his characteristic way,
“for several purposes: 1. To please myself, and to live
at the end of my days, in those scenes in which I began
them; 2. To make the life as long as nature, unthwarted
by smoke and confinement, would let it be; 3. To make
a complete Tullian farm; 4. To make a Locust coppice;
5. To raise garden seeds in the best possible manner.”</p>

</div>

<p>But nothing could ward off the perils incident
to late hours in London. After his first parliamentary
session, there were evident signs of his
constitution failing him; and, although revived
somewhat in summer, each new winter brought
back a cough, which forbade rest at night, and
gradually helped to bring the end nearer. A visit
to Ireland, in 1834, seemed to be undertaken w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>ith
all his old powers; his writing and his humour
were as good as ever. But the following winter
proved to be the last, and the early months of the
year 1835 were a constant struggle to keep up to
the post at which he meant to die.</p>

<p>Not that he meant to die, yet. There were new
plans, only a month before Cobbett’s death, which
exhibited anything but the lapse of mental or
physical power. There was to be a new <i>Cobbett’s
Evening Journal</i>, a special feature of which was the
full publication of important discussions in parliament,
which were not elsewhere faithfully reported:
those affairs, viz., in which Hume, and the
other economists beside himself, had the leading
share.</p>

<p>Also, the <i>Register</i> was to be dropped, “in full
blaze,” on his next birthday, the 9th of March,
1836:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Then, putting out the <i>Register</i>, at the end of the 91st
volume, I shall … have time to write a history of <span class="smcapuc">MY
OWN LIFE</span>, showing the progress of a ploughboy to a seat
in parliament; beginning his career by driving the rooks
and magpies from his father’s pea-fields and his mother’s
chicken-yard; and ending, by endeavouring to drive the
tithe and tax devourers from the fruits of the labour of
his industrious countrymen.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>as in the month of June, 1835, that Cobbett
had his first, and last, serious illness.</p>

<p>He still dictated material for the <i>Political
Register</i>, and continued personally to inspect his
little farm, at the last by being carried in a chair.
On the 16th his eldest son (writing to a friend)
speaks confidently of his being in a fair way of
getting strength again; and there was no very
great alarm until the following day. A sudden
change, however, occurred on that morning; his
strength gradually wasted; and on the 18th of
June, at a few minutes after one p.m., he passed
away, as gently as a child would fall asleep.</p>

public teaching. He said, on some occasion, many years ago, “It
is certain that I have been the great enlightener of the people of
England;” and so he was. The newspapers have not, that we are
aware, adverted to our deepest obligation to him. He was the
inventor of Twopenny Trash. Let the title be inscribed on his
monument. The infamous Six Acts, although they suspended the
machinery for awhile, of cheap political publications, could not
undo what had been done, nor avert its great immediate, and far
greater eventual utility. If only for that good work, honoured be
the memory of old Cobbett.”&mdash;(Mr. W. J. Fox, in the <i>Monthly
